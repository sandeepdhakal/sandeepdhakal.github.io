# Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

:::{.sticky-note}
"IPM: a decision support system for the selection and use of pest control tactics, singly or harmoniously coordinated into a management strategy, based on cost-benefit analyses that takes into account the interests of and impacts on producers, society, and the environment. Methods used in IPM can reduce pesticide use and conserve pesticide efficacy."

Magarey, R. D., Chappell, T. M., et al. (2019) [^magarey2019social]

Different IPM tactics include:

- crop rotation,
- biological control,
- monitoring,
- economic thresholds,
- resistant varieties

Effective management of pests through AWM requires an understanding of how the entire system functions across different scales, including proper assessment of the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of the pest and its required resources (e.g., food, shelter) [^vanklinken2019scale].

## Problems Faced

The large number of social actors and the complex interaction of ecological and social processes makes IPM a difficult task. Pest management is a complex system of ecological processes and social actors including a number of key facets [^magarey2019social]:

- grower decision-making is more strongly influenced by market forces and pesticide marketing.
- pest pressure as a result of selection pressure, resistant genotypes and emerging pests is not constant but tends to increase over time.
- loss of pesticide efficacy results in crop losses, which, in turn, leads to research and extension efforts to reduce these losses and pesticide environmental impacts.
- Research, especially on pesticide environmental impacts, is picked up by the media and environmental groups who lobby government agencies and in some cases litigate to enact regulatory changes that restrict or discourage pesticide availability and use.
- agriculture and food industry lobby government to keep pesticides registered and minimise regulations.

- poor coordination and prioritization of IMP strategies

- lack of a clear methodology to measure the environmental and economic benefits of IPM.
