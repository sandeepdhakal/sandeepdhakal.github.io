# How to deal with uncertainty?
- identify the types and sources of uncertainty
  - throughout the entire modelling process
  - beginning at the problem definition stage, integrated into the workflow and involve all relevant stakeholders

# Qualitative and quantitative
- what qualitative and quantitative data/information to use
- what are the expected/desired qualitative and quantitative outputs of the model?
- how to integrate/align quantitative/qualitative data, goals and outputs?

# Temporal and spatial scales
- what are the  temporal and spatial scales in the different sub-systems modelled?
- how will the different temporal/spatial scales and domains be aligned/adjusted for the system being modelled?
  
# Exploratory modelling
- ensure the ability of the model to test multiple hypothesis

# Heterogeneity
- allow for heterogeneity in all models, particularly from a social perspective
- agents should be boundedly rational
- not all agents will have the same level of knowledge: information asymmetry
- not all agents will make the same decisions given the same information: heterogeneity in terms of
  their decision-making

# More effective visualisation
- effective visualisations of model outputs or information, tailored to the audience
- integration of (near) real-time data inputs
- updates to outputs, predictions, etc. should happen within a reasonable time

# Information access and intervention
- The DT will need to be dynamic, allowing intervention by users and information extraction, and for users to be able to influence the system trajectory across time and space [^gilbert2018simulating].
