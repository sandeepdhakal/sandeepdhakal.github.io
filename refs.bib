The present study develops a new model based on Mathematical Programming-based Multi-Agent System (MPMAS), a simulation software that allows assessing ex-ante the impact of alternative pesticide use reduction strategies, including combinations of pesticide taxes, the introduction of integrated pest management, a price premium for safe agricultural produce, and subsidies for biopesticides. The model is parameterized with farm and plot level data from northern of Thailand, where the adoption of high-value cash crops has been accompanied by a rapid increase in synthetic pesticide use. Simulation results suggest that a pesticide tax alone has little effect on synthetic pesticide use. A smart policy package – combining integrated pest management, a progressive pesticide tax based on toxicity and subsidies lowering the price of biopesticides – can reduce average use of hazardous pesticides by 34% over current levels without adverse effects on the average farm income.},

   abstract = {A paradigm shift is needed to make agriculture sustainable, and various substitutes for intensive agriculture have been proposed. However, moving from theory to practice, in the context of climate change, natural resource depletion and worldwide economic and social disorder requires a novel approach that goes beyond the confines of ‘normal’ scientific practice, to (a) consider ecological and socioeconomic processes within the agricultural socio-ecosystem and (b) involving stakeholders in the research process. We propose an innovative experimental approach for identifying management practices that optimize multiple objectives, deliver a portfolio of ecosystem services and satisfy the social demands of key stakeholders while improving the socio-economic welfare of farmers. Social–ecological experiments are undertaken in real-field conditions, involving stakeholders explicitly, all along the experimental pathway, to help untangle the drivers of social–ecological dynamics under various practices of land management and farming. As an example, we describe a social–ecological experiment to reduce the intensity of weed control. These ‘social–ecological experiments’ go further, to participatory action research by not only involving stakeholders in the research process but also by manipulating simultaneously socioeconomic and ecological processes under real-field conditions to foster agroecological transition. Such experiments are distinct from adaptive management, participatory agricultural research and scenario-planning approaches as they highlight the interactions between ecological and social processes, manipulate the processes shaping the system and show causal links between patterns and processes. Social–ecological experiments offer great opportunities for increasing stakeholders' acceptance of environmental policies or sustainable agriculture programmes implemented through adaptive management. These experiments may help to identify management practices that deliver a portfolio of ecosystem services and satisfy key stakeholders.

   abstract = {Agent-based modelling is a valuable approach for systems whose behaviour is driven by the interactions between distinct entities. They have shown particular promise as a means of modelling crowds of people in streets, public transport terminals, stadiums, etc. However, the methodology faces a fundamental difficulty: there are no established mechanisms for dynamically incorporating real-time data into models. This limits simulations that are inherently dynamic, such as pedestrian movements, to scenario testing of, for example, the potential impacts of new architectural configurations on movements. This paper begins to address this fundamental gap by demonstrating how a particle filter could be used to incorporate real data into an agent-based model of pedestrian movements at run time. The experiments show that it is indeed possible to use a particle filter to perform online (real time) model optimisation. However, as the number of agents increases, the number of individual particles (and hence the computational complexity) required increases exponentially. By laying the groundwork for the real-time simulation of crowd movements, this paper has implications for the management of complex environments (both nationally and internationally) such as transportation hubs, hospitals, shopping centres, etc.},

   abstract = {Social mechanisms underpinning collaborative approaches to pest management are as important as the biological control of the pest. To facilitate the success of an area-wide management approach, social factors need to be understood and addressed. This study qualitatively analyses social, psychological and institutional barriers and facilitators for the widespread adoption of area-wide management of Queensland fruit fly, and attitudes towards the use of sterile insect technology. Interviews were conducted (N = 35) with fruit growers, industry representatives, agronomists, government representatives and community leaders from across the dominant horticultural regions of southeastern Australia. Transcripts were analysed and compared based on thematic organisations. Growers and stakeholders expressed high acceptance for area-wide management of Queensland fruit fly and the use of sterile insect technology. However, participants reported limited knowledge of both area-wide management and sterile insect technology. Factors found to facilitate acceptance were perceptions of increased market access, increased social awareness, operationalising community champions and value chain actors, as well as dissemination of credible scientific evidence. Trust in those individuals advocating area-wide management and sterile insect technology, and interpersonal trust between neighbours, was also seen as an important factor affecting adoption of area-wide management and sterile insect technology. Barriers to acceptance included perceptions of costs and ongoing funding needs, lack of knowledge, apathy towards control of Queensland fruit fly, compatibility of area-wide management and sterile insect technology with current practices and a lack of social cooperation amongst growers. The data show a need to increase growers’ awareness of costs and benefits associated with Queensland fruit fly control and an understanding of the direct and indirect consequences of their own on-farm behaviours with respect to control. This study is the first to use a psychological lens to explore and distil grower and stakeholder attitudes towards a cooperative management approach for a pest of national significance. Results provide insight into beliefs that guide underlying biosecurity decision-making and can help improve uptake of other area-wide control techniques.},

   abstract = {Modeling is essential to characterize and explore complex societal and environmental issues in systematic and collaborative ways. Socio-environmental systems (SES) modeling integrates knowledge and perspectives into conceptual and computational tools that explicitly recognize how human decisions affect the environment. Depending on the modeling purpose, many SES modelers also realize that involvement of stakeholders and experts is fundamental to support social learning and decision-making processes for achieving improved environmental and social outcomes. The contribution of this paper lies in identifying and formulating grand challenges that need to be overcome to accelerate the development and adaptation of SES modeling. Eight challenges are delineated: bridging epistemologies across disciplines; multi-dimensional uncertainty assessment and management; scales and scaling issues; combining qualitative and quantitative methods and data; furthering the adoption and impacts of SES modeling on policy; capturing structural changes; representing human dimensions in SES; and leveraging new data types and sources. These challenges limit our ability to effectively use SES modeling to provide the knowledge and information essential for supporting decision making. Whereas some of these challenges are not unique to SES modeling and may be pervasive in other scientific fields, they still act as barriers as well as research opportunities for the SES modeling community. For each challenge, we outline basic steps that can be taken to surmount the underpinning barriers. Thus, the paper identifies priority research areas in SES modeling, chiefly related to progressing modeling products, processes and practices.},

   abstract = {Control of mobile pests frequently requires area-wide management (AWM) that spans commercial and non-commercial habitats. Spatial modelling of habitat suitability can guide investment and implementation of AWM, but current approaches rarely capture population drivers, including local foraging, at an appropriate spatial resolution. To support the development of AWM for the fruit fly pest, Bactrocera tryoni (Tephritidae), we developed a habitat suitability model for the three premier fruit-growing regions in south-eastern Australia (~34,780 km2). Expert elicitation and published literature was used to develop a Bayesian network to model the drivers of B. tryoni habitat suitability, as determined by the ability of populations to persist and increase. The effect of uncertainty was tested through sensitivity analysis. The model was then linked with spatially explicit data (at 10 m resolution) to generate risk maps, using moving windows to capture local foraging movement. Habitat suitability was most strongly influenced by host availability within a distance of 200 m. Climate stress, and soil moisture for pupation, was also limiting. Experts were uncertain regarding the relative importance of drivers of host availability (host preference, host density, fruit seasonality), but this did not greatly affect model outputs. Independent trapping data supported model predictions, but their value was limited as traps were placed almost exclusively in optimal or suitable habitat. Amenability to AWM, when assessed as the ratio of suitable or optimal habitat that was under non-horticultural versus horticultural land-uses, differed by region (0.15–1.17). However, risk-mapping did identify where ratios were locally most favourable (lowest). Also, predominantly local dispersal by B. tryoni suggests AWM for pest suppression could be applied at a landscape-scale. Results show that a relatively simple model could capture the multi-scale drivers of population dynamics and the complexity of landscapes sufficiently to guide AWM of a mobile pest.},

   abstract = {Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera (Dacus) tryoni (QFF) is arguably the most costly horticultural insect pest in Australia. Despite this, no model is available to describe its population dynamics and aid in its management. This paper describes a cohort-based model of the population dynamics of the Queensland fruit fly. The model is primarily driven by weather variables, and so can be used at any location where appropriate meteorological data are available.\nIn the model, the life cycle is divided into a number of discreet stages to allow physiological processes to be defined as accurately as possible. Eggs develop and hatch into larvae, which develop into pupae, which emerge as either teneral females or males. Both females and males can enter reproductive and over-wintering life stages, and there is a trapped male life stage to allow model predictions to be compared with trap catch data.\nAll development rates are temperature-dependent. Daily mortality rates are temperature-dependent, but may also be influenced by moisture, density of larvae in fruit, fruit suitability, and age. Eggs, larvae and pupae all have constant "establishment" mortalities, causing a defined proportion of individuals to die upon entering that life stage. Transfer from one immature stage to the next is based on physiological age. In the adult life stages, transfer between stages may require additional and/or alternative functions. Maximum fecundity is 1 400 eggs per female per day, and maximum daily oviposition rate is 80 eggs/female per day. The actual number of eggs laid by a female on any given day is restricted by temperature, density of larva in fruit, suitability of fruit for oviposition, and female activity. Activity of reproductive females and males, which affects reproduction and trapping, decreases with rainfall. Trapping of reproductive males is determined by activity, temperature and the proportion of males in the active population.\nLimitations of the model are discussed. Despite these, the model provides a useful agreement with trap catch data, and allows key areas for future research to be identified. These critical gaps in the current state of knowledge exist despite over 50 years of research on this key pest. By explicitly attempting to model the population dynamics of this pest we have clearly identified the research areas that must be addressed before progress can be made in developing the model into an operational tool for the management of Queensland fruit fly.},

The ability to tolerate climatic diversity is uncommon among insects, and understanding the population phenology drivers of such species across different parts of their range will be critical for their management. Here, we determined the role of temperature versus fruit availability on the population phenology of Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni. Using a field site located at the subtropical/temperate interface, with host fruits continuously available, we monitored the development times and abundance of B. tryoni, a species which has invaded temperate Australia from the tropics. From fruit samples held at ambient and controlled conditions, the abundance of emerging flies was highly variable among collection dates, but the variance did not reflect the observed changes in temperature. For most samples, the survival rate of flies in a field site was lower than predicted by a day-degree population model fitted with mean daily field temperatures. The development time of the immature stage in the field was prolonged, presumably due to cooler ambient conditions, but the fitted day-degree population model consistently over-predicted estimated development times. Our results indicate that at the subtropical/temperate interface, the decline in B. tryoni populations during winter is only partly driven by temperature and host availability. We classify B. tryoni as a climate generalist, which likely employs physiological as well as behavioural mechanisms to achieve broad climatic tolerance ranges.},

   abstract = {Surveillance for invading insect pests is costly and the trapper usually finds the traps empty of the target pest. Since the successful establishment of new pests is an uncommon event, multiple lures placed into one trap might increase the efficiency of the surveillance system. We investigated the effect of the combination of the Tephritidae male lures – trimedlure, cuelure, raspberry ketone and methyl eugenol – on catch of Ceratitis capitata, Zeugodacus cucurbitae, Bactrocera tryoni, B. dorsalis, B. aquilonis and B. tenuifascia in Australia and the USA (not all species are present in each country). The increase in trap density required to offset any reduction in catch due to the presence of lures for other Tephritidae was estimated. The effect of increasing trap density to maintain surveillance sensitivity was modelled for a hypothetical population of B. tryoni males, where the effective sampling area of cuelure traps for this species has been estimated. The 3-way combination significantly reduced the catch of the methyl eugenol-responsive B. dorsalis. Unexpectedly, we found that trimedlure-baited traps that contained methyl eugenol had ×3.1 lower catch of C. capitata than in trimedlure-only-baited traps in Australia, but not in Hawaii where no difference in catch was observed, we cannot satisfactorily explain this result. Based on the data presented here and from previous research, combinations of some male lures for the early detection of tephritid flies appear compatible and where there is any reduction in surveillance sensitivity observed, this can be offset by increasing the density of traps in the area.},

   abstract = {Context: Animal population dynamics are shaped by their movement decisions in response to spatial and temporal resource availability across landscapes. The sporadic availability and diversity of resources can create highly dynamic systems. This is especially true in agro-ecological landscapes where the dynamic interplay of insect movement and heterogeneous landscapes hampers prediction of their spatio-temporal dynamics and population size. Objectives: We therefore systematically looked at population-level consequences of different movement strategies in temporally-dynamic resource landscapes for an insect species whose movement strategy is slightly understood: the Queensland Fruit Fly (Bactrocera tryoni) Methods: We developed a spatially-explicit model to predict changes in population dynamics and sizes in response to varying resources across a landscape. We simulated the temporal dynamics of fruit trees as the main resource using empirical fruiting dates. Movement strategies were derived from general principles and varied in directedness of movement and movement trigger. Results: We showed that temporal continuity in resource availability was the main contributing factor for large and persistent populations. This explicitly included presence of continuous low-density resources such as fruit trees in urban areas. Analysing trapping data from SE Australia supported this finding. We also found strong effects of movement strategies, with directed movement supporting higher population densities. Conclusions: These results give insight into structuring processes of spatial population dynamics of Queensland Fruit Fly in realistic and complex food production landscapes, but can also be extended to other systems. Such mechanistic understanding will help to improve forecasting of spatio-temporal hotspots and bottlenecks and will, in the end, enable more targeted population management.},

   abstract = {The aim of this work is to present the first results obtained by means of the new validation of the water balance and crop development model CRITERIA-ID, specifically set up for the SWAMP (Smart Water Management Platform) platform on one of the pilots, in the framework of the SWAMP project, aimed at providing support for precision irrigation in agriculture. The platform consists of an IoT solution for monitoring the farming and irrigation systems combined with data analytic solution to assess the irrigation need of plants, and support for irrigation planning and water distribution both at farm and district level. CRITERIA-ID has been tested on two test cases for the Italian pilot, located in the land reclamation and irrigation consortium of Emilia Centrale (North Italy). The comparison of crop irrigation water needs computed by CRITERIA-ID with actual irrigation performed by farmers has been carried out, together with a comparison of crop water stress. The analysis has shown that for both the test cases the two data series are comparable, but some differences have been highlighted: in some cases the farmer irrigation is not decided on the basis of the actual water needs of the crops but on farm management decisions. In addition, if the total annual volumes of irrigation of the two series are comparable, the scheduling is different, where the observed irrigation data bring the crop to too high (or too low) level of water stress. Thus, the present work has shown that the application of CRITERIA-ID simulation model is a valid tool to support irrigation management because it allows an optimal use of the resource avoiding crop yield losses with a rational irrigation scheduling. The reliability of these outcomes sets the conditions for further exploitation of the model in the future, firstly for its integration into the SWAMP platform.},

   abstract = {This paper describes the development of a systems based model to characterise farmers' decision-making process in information-intensive practices, and its evaluation in the context of Precision Agriculture (PA). A participative methodology was developed in which farm managers decomposed their process of decision-making into brief decision statements along with associated information requirements. The methodology was first developed on a university research farm in Denmark and further revised during testing on a number of research and commercial farms in Indiana, USA. Twenty-one decision-analysis factors were identified to characterise a farm manager's decision-making process. Then, a general data flow diagram (DFD) was constructed that describes the information flows "from data to decision". Illustrative examples of the model in the form of DFDs are presented for a strategic, a tactical and an operational decision. The model was validated for a range of decisions related to operations by three university farm managers and by five commercial farmers practicing PA for cereal, corn and soybean production in Denmark and in Indiana, USA. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {“When I use a word, it means whatever I want it to mean”: Humpty Dumpty in Alice’s Adventures Through The Looking Glass, Lewis Carroll. “Digital twin” is currently a term applied in a wide variety of ways. Some differences are variations from sector to sector, but definitions within a sector can also vary significantly. Within engineering, claims are made regarding the benefits of using digital twinning for design, optimisation, process control, virtual testing, predictive maintenance, and lifetime estimation. In many of its usages, the distinction between a model and a digital twin is not made clear. The danger of this variety and vagueness is that a poor or inconsistent definition and explanation of a digital twin may lead people to reject it as just hype, so that once the hype and the inevitable backlash are over the final level of interest and use (the “plateau of productivity”) may fall well below the maximum potential of the technology. The basic components of a digital twin (essentially a model and some data) are generally comparatively mature and well-understood. Many of the aspects of using data in models are similarly well-understood, from long experience in model validation and verification and from development of boundary, initial and loading conditions from measured values. However, many interesting open questions exist, some connected with the volume and speed of data, some connected with reliability and uncertainty, and some to do with dynamic model updating. In this paper we highlight the essential differences between a model and a digital twin, outline some of the key benefits of using digital twins, and suggest directions for further research to fully exploit the potential of the approach.},

@article{fleming2021foresighting,
   abstract = {CONTEXT: Public and private research institutions are grappling with the challenges and opportunities of embedding dimensions of responsible innovation within their research and development programs, including those seeking to transform agricultural productivity and sustainability through digital technologies. Central to meeting this challenge is building institutional, organisational and professional capacity for anticipation and reflexiveness within multidisciplinary research communities. Foresighting methodologies provide a means by which this might be usefully and practically enabled, whilst also shedding light on the broader social and ethical implications of alternative agricultural technology development pathways under uncertain environmental and industry futures. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the results of a participatory foresighting exercise undertaken as part of a large, publicly funded multi-disciplinary research initiative designed to build a common big data infrastructure to harness the benefits of the digital revolution for the Australian agricultural and land sectors. We seek to explore what role digital technology will play in the future of Australian agriculture and to consider the social and ethical implications. METHODS: We ran a one-day foresighting workshop comprised of four steps – 1) horizon scanning to identify trends 2) selecting two drivers of change 3) producing a matrix to generate scenarios 4) building and refining scenarios. Participants explored different possible futures of farming in Australia, with a focus on scenarios involving socio-technical dimensions of digital agriculture to consider the implications of these futures for research practice and for farming communities. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Four scenarios were developed, distinguished by the interplay of two critical but uncertain drivers of change identified by participants, namely: the degree of resource security or insecurity that future agricultural enterprises are likely to experience; and the degree to which farming sectors maintain traditional farm business models and associated value chains or transition to more diverse or innovative business models. The process highlighted the need to increase the capacity and opportunity for more reflexivity in research and development, if positive outcomes were to be achieved. SIGNIFICANCE: The scenarios we produced provide a catalyst for conversation about the implications of digital technology development in Australia and globally, for industry, policy and research and development. In particular, the scenarios highlight potential changes in farm business models, decision making, and beneficiaries and inequities of new technologies and other components of food value chains. The paper also serves as a guide and prompt for others, by demonstrating one way reflexivity can be achieved in organisations attempting innovation.},

The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin.},

Although the spatio-temporal behaviour of some groups, such as commuters, are captured in sources such as population censuses, much less is known about groups such as retired people who have less documented behaviour patterns. This paper uses agent-based modelling to disaggregate some ambient population data to estimate the size and demographics of the constituent populations during the day. This is accomplished by first building a model of commuters to model typical 9–5 workday patterns. The differences between the model outputs and real footfall data (the error) can be an indication of the contributions that other groups make to the overall footfall. The research then iteratively simulates a wider range of demographic groups, maximising the correspondence between the model and data at each stage. An application of this methodology to the town centre of Otley, West Yorkshire, UK, is presented. Ultimately this approach could lead to a better understanding about how town- and city-centres are used by residents and visitors, contributing useful information in a situation where raw data on the populations do not exist.},

Key element in this policy is a fully sustainable food system outlined in the farm-to-fork strategy. Such strategy requires a systems approach in which all aspects related to the production and consumption of sufficient and healthy food are considered, including economic, environmental (climate, ecosystems) and social aspects. Scope and approach: Here, we present the systems approach concept for food production, following the farm-to-fork principle as embraced by the EC, and elaborate on how digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can solve the challenges that a sustainable food system imposes. Key findings and conclusions: We present a number of research and innovation challenges and illustrate these by some specific examples. It is concluded that AI and digitalisation show great potential to support the transition towards a sustainable food system. This development will impact the roles and interactions of the actors in the entire value chain from farmers to consumers. Policy recommendations are made for a successful future implementation of AI in sustainable food production.},

   abstract = {World agriculture faces the challenge of increasing its agricultural production by 50 % from 2012 to 2050, while reducing water consumption, as agriculture accounts for 69 % of all fresh water used on the planet. The use of technologies such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, digital twins, among others, in the agricultural environment is increasing. Digital twin applied to agriculture is in its early stages of development. A digital twin is one in which data flows automatically and in both directions between a physical object and a virtual object. Withing this context, this paper presents a digital twin of a smart irrigation system in an application scenario. A digital twin for an irrigation system is one in which the physical components of the system, such as its sensors and actuators, are connected with their virtual representations. The system is composed of a FIWARE-based internet of things platform and a discrete event simulation model in Siemens Plant Simulation software. The internet of things platform is used to collect, aggregate and process soil, weather and crop data to calculate daily irrigation prescriptions. The simulation model is used to simulate the behavior of an irrigation system defined in an application scenario. The communication between the platform and the simulation model happens in real-time and is intermediate by an OPC UA server. A application scenario is considered to evaluate the behavior of the system and to evaluate, in future research, different irrigation strategies. The benefits of the systems proposed are twofold. First, evaluate the behavior of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform and an irrigation system before implementing both in the field. Second, enable the evaluation of different irrigation strategies in parallel with current farm practices. Within the system proposed, farmers can evaluate the behavior of the system before implementing in their farms and allowing the system to operate automatically. It is possible to infer that the system can improve farm operations and reduce water usage by allowing farmers to gather soil, weather and crop information and evaluate multiple irrigation strategies.},

However, current evacuation times and plans for natural disaster management leave underserved communities vulnerable to substantial financial and welfare losses, especially when false positives during current predictions continue to influence evacuation decisions. A Machine Learning ABM (ML-ABM) model of hurricane trajectories introduces a pioneering opportunity to capture complex physical processes associated with hurricanes while minimizing computational costs and errors, thereby providing more accurate real-time prediction of hurricanes for improved disaster management. This Hurricane Track Prediction ML-ABM model aims to quickly model and predict hurricane tracks in only a few minutes while retaining some of the complex physical process interactions of real storms through feature engineering and deep learning. This work focuses on the implementation of an RNN with bidirectional time-distributed Long-Short Term Memory cells, accounting for positive and negative time direction in time series forecasting. The observations and predictions were represented as a multi-agent system in NetLogo for further emergent pattern analysis in an expanded research by Arthur Drake et. al (2020). The model also evaluates benchmark comparisons against the National Hurricane Center’s 5-Year Average Forecast Errors and the BCD5 Error Model, a combined intensity and track prediction error model that utilizes best track input and models decay over land.},

   abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) have enabled great advances in the study of tumor development and therapeutic response, allowing researchers to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the tumor and its microenvironment. However, these models face serious drawbacks in the realm of parameterization – ABM parameters are typically set individually based on various data and literature sources, rather than through a rigorous parameter estimation approach. While ABMs can be fit to simple time-course data (such as tumor volume), that type of data loses the spatial information that is a defining feature of ABMs. While tumor images provide spatial information, it is exceedingly difficult to compare tumor images to ABM simulations beyond a qualitative visual comparison. Without a quantitative method of comparing the similarity of tumor images to ABM simulations, a rigorous parameter fitting is not possible. Here, we present a novel approach that applies neural networks to represent both tumor images and ABM simulations as low dimensional points, with the distance between points acting as a quantitative measure of difference between the two. This enables a quantitative comparison of tumor images and ABM simulations, where the distance between simulated and experimental images can be minimized using standard parameter-fitting algorithms. Here, we describe this method and present two examples to demonstrate the application of the approach to estimate parameters for two distinct ABMs. Overall, we provide a novel method to robustly estimate ABM parameters.},

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood.

   abstract = {Background:Agent-based models are valuable for examining systems where large numbers of discrete individuals interact with each other, or with some environment. Diabetic Veterans seeking eye care at a Veterans Administration hospital represent one such cohort.Objective:The objective of this study was to develop an agent-based template to be used as a model for a patient with diabetic retinopathy (DR). This template may be replicated arbitrarily many times in order to generate a large cohort which is representative of a real-world population, upon which in-silico experimentation may be conducted.Methods:Agent-based template development was performed in java-based computer simulation suite AnyLogic Professional 6.6. The model was informed by medical data abstracted from 535 patient records representing a retrospective cohort of current patients of the VA St. Louis Healthcare System Eye clinic. Logistic regression was performed to determine the predictors associated with advancing stages of DR. Predicted probabilities obtained from logistic regression were used to generate the stage of DR in the simulated cohort.Results:The simulated cohort of DR patients exhibited no significant deviation from the test population of real-world patients in proportion of stage of DR, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), or the other abstracted predictors. Simulated patients after 10 years were significantly more likely to exhibit proliferative DR (P<0.001).Conclusions:Agent-based modeling is an emerging platform, capable of simulating large cohorts of individuals based on manageable data abstraction efforts. The modeling method described may be useful in simulating many different conditions where course of disease is described in categorical stages.},

By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their neighborhoods' features, we enable (implicitly) specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).},

   abstract = {Societies are complex. Properties of social systems can be explained by the interplay and weaving of individual actions. Rewards are key to understand people’s choices and decisions. For instance, individual preferences of where to live may lead to the emergence of social segregation. In this paper, we combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Agent Based Modeling (ABM) in order to address the self-organizing dynamics of social segregation and explore the space of possibilities that emerge from considering different types of rewards. Our model promotes the creation of interdependencies and interactions among multiple agents of two different kinds that segregate from each other. For this purpose, agents use Deep Q-Networks to make decisions inspired on the rules of the Schelling Segregation model and rewards for interactions. Despite the segregation reward, our experiments show that spatial integration can be achieved by establishing interdependencies among agents of different kinds. They also reveal that segregated areas are more probable to host older people than diverse areas, which attract younger ones. Through this work, we show that the combination of RL and ABM can create an artificial environment for policy makers to observe potential and existing behaviors associated to rules of interactions and rewards.},

The objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid reinforcement learning–graph embedding network model that 1) simulates complex construction planning environments using agent-based modeling and 2) minimizes computational burdens in establishing activity sequences and work breakdown formations. Three case studies with practical construction scheduling problems were used to demonstrate applicability of the developed model.

   abstract = {Customer retention is a critical concern for mobile network operators because of the increasing competition in the mobile services sector. Such unease has driven companies to exploit data as an avenue to better understand changing customer behavior. Data-mining techniques such as clustering and classification have been widely adopted in the mobile services sector to better understand customer retention. However, the effectiveness of these techniques is debatable due to the constant change and increasing complexity of the mobile market itself. This design study proposes an application of agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) as a novel approach to understanding customer behavior through the combination of market and social factors that emerge from data. External forces at play and possible company interventions can then be added to data-derived models. A dataset provided by a mobile network operator is utilized to automate decision-tree analysis and subsequent building of agent-based models. Popular churn modeling techniques were adopted in order to automate the development of models, from decision trees, and subsequently explore possible customer churn scenarios. ABMS is used to understand the behavior of customers and detect reasons why customers churned or stayed with their respective mobile network operators. A CART decision-tree method is presented that identifies agents, selects important attributes, and uncovers customer behavior – easily identifying tenure, location, and choice of mobile devices as determinants for the churn-or-stay decision. Word of mouth between customers is also explored as a possible influence factor. Importantly, methods for automating data-driven agent-based simulation model generation will support faster exploration and experimentation – including with those determinants from a wider market or social context.},

Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors.

   abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) have been adopted to simulate different kinds of complex systems, from biological systems to complex coupled human-natural systems (CHANS). In particular, when used to simulate man-managed systems, they allow considering human behavioural aspects within the modelling framework. On the other hand, environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has become an acknowledged tool in research, industry and policy to assess systems’ environmental sustainability. More recently, LCA is being applied to assess the potential environmental impacts of large scale policy actions (e.g., actions to combat climate change). This paper describes the application of a coupled ABM-LCA model to simulate cropping activities in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The ABM considers farmers’ proneness to risk, which was assessed via a naïve Bayesian model trained with the results of a survey distributed to the farmers of the study region. The goal of the study is to assess the effects of the agents’ interactions, that can take place in a farmers’ social network, on the agricultural activities. Geographic Information System (GIS) information, national statistics and naïve Bayesian model are used to parameterize agents’ behaviour and interaction rules. We believe such assessment is necessary for the successful design of public adaptation strategies and subsidy schemes since governmental adaptation actions are needed to reduce emissions due to agricultural activities. Two scenarios (with different levels of farmers’ environmental awareness) were simulated. The results show that the mean and variance of the distribution of farmers’ environmental awareness change due to the effect of the interactions and, as a consequence, farmers’ long-term decisions concerning agricultural activities are affected. This is reflected in the environmental impacts generated by such activities.},

In today’s digitalized world, these techniques have been combined with IoT technology and machine learning algorithms, which have given rise to smart agriculture systems. However, farmers who live in developing countries hesitate to use such systems because of their hardware and maintenance costs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a low-cost farmland digital twin framework called AgriLoRa for smart agriculture. AgriLoRa consists of a wireless sensor network established in the farmland and cloud servers that run computer vision algorithms to detect plant diseases, weed clusters and plant nutrient deficiencies. In order to assess the feasibility of accurate plant disease detection, we have performed initial experiments with agricultural vision datasets using two different algorithms, the MobileNet and UNet models, and achieved successful results. AgriLoRa is promising to achieve a low-cost, high-precision smart agriculture solution to address the growing high-yield production needs of farmers worldwide.},

   abstract = {In this proof-of-concept work, we evaluate the performance of multiple machine-learning methods as surrogate models for use in the analysis of agent-based models (ABMs). Analysing agent-based modelling outputs can be challenging, as the relationships between input parameters can be non-linear or even chaotic even in relatively simple models, and each model run can require significant CPU time. Surrogate modelling, in which a statistical model of the ABM is constructed to facilitate detailed model analyses, has been proposed as an alternative to computationally costly Monte Carlo methods. Here we compare multiple machine-learning methods for ABM surrogate modelling in order to determine the approaches best suited as a surrogate for modelling the complex behaviour of ABMs. Our results suggest that, in most scenarios, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and gradient-boosted trees outperform Gaussian process surrogates, currently the most commonly used method for the surrogate modelling of complex computational models. ANNs produced the most accurate model replications in scenarios with high numbers of model runs, although training times were longer than the other methods. We propose that agent-based modelling would benefit from using machine-learning methods for surrogate modelling, as this can facilitate more robust sensitivity analyses for the models while also reducing CPU time consumption when calibrating and analysing the simulation.},

Because of this, data science techniques inevitably have a crucial role to play in making sense of this complex, highly heterogeneous data. This short article reflects on the role of data science in digital twins of the natural environment, with particular attention on how resultant data models can work alongside the rich legacy of process models that exist in this domain. We seek to unpick the complex two-way relationship between data and process understanding. By focusing on the interactions, we end up with a template for digital twins that incorporates a rich, highly dynamic learning process with the potential to handle the complexities and emergent behaviors of this important area.},

Therefore, the target of this paper is to propose a framework to design a forest digital twin (FDT) that, by integrating different state variables at both tree and forest levels, creates a virtual copy of the forest. The integration of these data sets could be used for scientific purposes, for reporting the health status of forests, and ultimately for implementing sustainable forest management practices on the basis of the use cases that a specific implementation of the framework would underpin. Achieving such outcomes requires the twinning of single trees as a core element of the FDT by recording the physical and biotic state variables of the tree and of the near environment via real–virtual digital sockets. Following a nested approach, the twinned trees and the related physical and physiological processes are then part of a broader twinning of the entire forest realized by capturing data at forest scale from sources such as remote sensing technologies and flux towers. Ultimately, to unlock the economic value of forest ecosystem services, the FDT should implement a distributed ledger-based on blockchain and smart contracts to ensure the highest transparency, reliability, and thoroughness of the data and the related transactions and to sharpen forest risk management with the final goal to improve the capital flow towards sustainable practices of forest management.},

A case study related to the Archeological Park of Pompeii will be presented, where real-time collected data is managed and shared via a web-cloud-IoT platform. Then, collected data are analyzed through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to prevent future issues related to Cultural Heritage Buildings, particularly humidity inside structures, which is crucial for ancient building preservation.},

   abstract = {Access to real-time environmental sensing data is key to representing real-time environmental changes in the digital twin of lakes. The visualization of environmental sensing data is an important part of establishing a digital twin of lakes. In the past, environmental sensing data display methods were either charts or two-dimensional map-based visualization methods. Breaking through the traditional visualization methods of environmental sensing data and realizing a multi-dimensional and multi-view display of environmental sensing data in a digital twin of lakes is something that this particular paper tries to resolve. This study proposes a visualization framework to integrate, manage, analyze, and visualize the environmental sensing data in the digital twin of lakes. In addition, this study also seeks to realize the coupling expression of geospatial data and long-term monitoring sequence data. Different visualization methods are used to realize the visualization of environmental sensing data in the digital twin of lakes. Using vector and scalar visualization methods to display ambient wireless sensor monitoring data in a digital twin of lakes provides researchers with richer visualization methods and means for deeper analysis. Using video fusion technology to display environmental sensing video surveillance data strengthens the integration of the virtual environment and real space and saves time for position identification using video surveillance. These findings may also help realize the integration and management of real-time environmental sensing data in a digital twin of lakes. The visualization framework uses various visualization methods to express the monitoring data of environmental wireless sensors and increases the means of visualizing environmental sensing data in the world of a lake digital twin. This visualization framework is also a general approach that can be applied to all similar lakes, or other geographical scenarios where environmental sensing devices are deployed. The establishment of a digital twin of Poyang Lake has certain practical significance for improving the digital management level of Poyang Lake and monitoring its ecological changes. Poyang Lake is used as an example to verify the proposed framework and method, which shows that the framework can be applied to the construction of a lake-oriented digital twin.},

   abstract = {Agriculture's reliance on ecosystem services creates economic and ecological interdependencies between crop production and biodiversity. Interactions with mobile organisms are particularly complex because they depend on the spatial configuration of habitat at large scales. As such conserving habitat is likely to benefit multiple farmers whereas conservation costs are born individually, creating potential interdependencies among farmers. We explore under what conditions landscape-scale management of ecosystem services is likely to benefit farmers compared to managing them at the farm-scale. To do this we develop an agent-based model (ABM) to predict the landscape configuration emerging from farm-scale management under different conditions: initial landscape, crop and pollinator characteristics. As a benchmark, the landscape configuration from landscape-scale management is derived through a global optimization procedure. Not only do we find that efficiency improves with landscape-scale management, but also that all farmers would benefit from it (given dependence of crop yields on ecosystem services). However, we also find that the individual incentives to avoid maintaining habitat on one's own land are relatively high; therefore creating conditions for a Prisoner's Dilemma-type problem. On the other hand we also demonstrate that an incentive-compatible contract exists that can promote efficient landscape management (by combining side-payments with fines for defection). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Global advances in sensors, communications, digital technologies, and computational capacity offer this potential. Here we review past efforts to advance subsurface investigation techniques and technologies, and computational efforts to create a digital twin (representation) of subsurface processes. In the context of the potential to link measurement and sensing to a digital twin computation platform, we outline five criteria that might make it possible. Significant advances in sensors based on passive measurement devices are proposed. As an example of what might be achievable, using the five criteria, we describe the deployment of online real-time sensors and simulations for a case study of a petroleum site where natural source zone depletion (NSZD) is underway as a potential biodegradation management option, and where a high-quality conceptual site model is available. Multiple sensors targeting parameters (major gases and temperature influenced by soil moisture) relevant to the subsurface NSZD biodegradation processes are shown to offer the potential to map subsurface processes spatially and temporally and provide continuous estimates of degradation rates for management decisions, constrained by a computational platform of the key processes. Current limitations and gaps in technologies and knowledge are highlighted specific to the case study. More generally, additional key advances required to achieve autonomous sensing of subsurface soil and groundwater pollutants are outlined.},

   abstract = {Background: Digital twins have advanced fast in various industries, but are just emerging in postharvest supply chains. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a certain product, such as fresh horticultural produce. This twin is linked to the real-world product by sensors supplying data of the environmental conditions near the target fruit or vegetable. Statistical and data-driven twins quantify how quality loss of fresh horticultural produce occurs by grasping patterns in the data. Physics-based twins provide an augmented insight into the underlying physical, biochemical, microbiological and physiological processes, enabling to explain also why this quality loss occurs. Scope and approach: We identify what the key advantages are of digital twins and how the supply chain of fresh horticultural produce can benefit from them in the future. Key findings and conclusions: A digital twin has a huge potential to help horticultural produce to tell its history as it drifts along throughout its postharvest life. The reason is that each shipment is subject to a unique and unpredictable set of temperature and gas atmosphere conditions from farm to consumer. Digital twins help to identify the resulting, largely uncharted, postharvest evolution of food quality. The benefit of digital twins particularly comes forward for perishable species and at low airflow rates. Digital twins provide actionable data for exporters, retailers, and consumers, such as the remaining shelf life for each shipment, on which logistics decisions and marketing strategies can be based. The twins also help diagnose and predict potential problems in supply chains that will reduce food quality and induce food loss. Twins can even suggest preventive shipment-tailored measures to reduce retail and household food losses.},

   abstract = {Analysis of Earth system dynamics in the Anthropocene requires explicitly taking into account the increasing magnitude of processes operating in human societies, their cultures, economies and technosphere and their growing feedback entanglement with those in the physical, chemical and biological systems of the planet. However, current state-of-the-art Earth system models do not represent dynamic human societies and their feedback interactions with the biogeophysical Earth system and macroeconomic integrated assessment models typically do so only with limited scope. This paper (i) proposes design principles for constructing world-Earth models (WEMs) for Earth system analysis of the Anthropocene, i.e., models of social (world)-ecological (Earth) coevolution on up to planetary scales, and (ii) presents the copan:CORE open simulation modeling framework for developing, composing and analyzing such WEMs based on the proposed principles. The framework provides a modular structure to flexibly construct and study WEMs. These can contain biophysical (e.g., carbon cycle dynamics), socio-metabolic or economic (e.g., economic growth or energy system changes), and sociocultural processes (e.g., voting on climate policies or changing social norms) and their feedback interactions, and they are based on elementary entity types, e.g., grid cells and social systems. Thereby, copan:CORE enables the epistemic flexibility needed for contributions towards Earth system analysis of the Anthropocene given the large diversity of competing theories and methodologies used for describing socio-metabolic or economic and sociocultural processes in the Earth system by various fields and schools of thought. To illustrate the capabilities of the framework, we present an exemplary and highly stylized WEM implemented in copan:CORE that illustrates how endogenizing sociocultural processes and feedbacks such as voting on climate policies based on socially learned environmental awareness could fundamentally change macroscopic model outcomes.},

   abstract = {Smart farming (also referred to as digital farming, digital agriculture and precision agriculture) has largely been driven by productivity and efficiency aims, but there is an increasing awareness of potential socio-ethical challenges. The responsible research and innovation (RRI) approach aims to address such challenges but has had limited application in smart farming contexts. Using smart dairying research and development (R&D) in New Zealand (NZ) as a case study, we examine the extent to which principles of RRI have been applied in NZ smart dairying development and assess the broader lessons for RRI application in smart farming. We draw on insights from: a review of research on dairy technology use in NZ; interviews with smart dairying stakeholders; and the application of an analytical framework based on RRI dimensions. We conclude that smart dairying R&D and innovation activities have focused on technology development and on-farm use without considering socio-ethical implications and have excluded certain actors such as citizens and consumers. This indicates that readiness to enact RRI in this context is not yet optimal, and future RRI efforts require leadership by government or dairy sector organisations to fully embed RRI principles in the guidelines for large R&D project design (what has also been referred to as ‘RRI maturity’). More broadly, enacting RRI in smart farming requires initial identification of RRI readiness in a given sector or country and devising a roadmap and coherent project portfolio to support capacity building for enacting RRI. Additionally, methods (such as RRI indicators) for operationalising RRI must be adapted to the context of the national or sectoral innovation system in which smart farming is being developed.},

   abstract = {Machine learning (ML) algorithms steer agent decisions in agent-based models (ABMs), serving as a vehicle for implementing behaviour changes during simulation runs. However, when training an ML algorithm, obtaining large sets of micro-level human behaviour data is often problematic. Information on human behaviour is often collected via surveys of relatively small sample sizes. This paper presents a methodology for training a learning algorithm to guide agent behaviour in a spatial ABM using a limited survey data sample. We apply different implementation strategies using survey data and Bayesian networks (BNs). By being grounded in probabilistic directed graphical models, BNs stand out among other learning algorithms in that they can be based on expert knowledge and/or known datasets. This paper presents four alternative implementations of data-driven BNs to support agent decisions in a spatial ABM. We differentiate between training BNs prior to, or during the simulation runs, using only survey data or a combination of survey data and expert knowledge. The four different implementations are then illustrated using a spatial ABM of cholera diffusion for Kumasi, Ghana. The results indicate that a balance between expert knowledge and survey data provides the best control over the learning process of the agents and produces the most realistic agent behaviour.},

@article{aggarwal2023understanding,
   abstract = {This paper is motivated by the question: how does governance emerge within social-ecological systems (SESs)? Addressing this question is critical for fostering sustainable transformations because it directs attention to the context specific and process intensive nature of governance as arising from the internal dynamics (i.e., interplay of feedbacks and interdependencies between the components) of SESs. This contrasts with the commonly held view of governance as an external intervention applied to a system. To systematically examine the recurrent patterns in how the internal dynamics promote/detract from the emergence of different types of governance, we applied archetype analysis to 60 selected cases of irrigation systems from Asia. Drawing inspiration from grid-group typology of cultural theory, we developed four specific archetypes: egalitarian, individualist, hierarchical, and fatalist. To build these archetypes, we applied a robustness framework and several other theories/perspectives to identify the different social-ecological and infrastructural attributes of irrigation SESs, and their interdependencies and feedback structures. We then used these attributes, identified through our theoretical review, to deductively code our selected cases and classify them into the different archetypes. The results show the different configurations of attributes that co-occur in each archetype, and how together these attributes and their inter-relationships lead to specific types of governance. Our archetype analysis also provides several interesting examples of fine-tuning between different SES attributes and how this fine-tuning is being threatened by various social and environmental changes. Through a systematic exploration of recurrent patterns using archetype analysis, our work builds on past efforts to apply ideas from complexity theory—specifically emergence—to unpack the complexities of SESs and offer practical guidance for fostering sustainability.},

In this review, we survey the literature on integrated human-Earth system models, quantify the direction and strength of feedbacks in those models, and put them in context of other, more frequently considered, feedbacks in the Earth system. We find that such feedbacks have the potential to alter both human and Earth systems; however, there is significant uncertainty in these results, and the number of truly integrated studies remains small. More research, more models, and more studies are needed to robustly quantify the sign and magnitude of human-Earth system feedbacks.

In this context, Digital Twin (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management.

@article{cheshire2014governing,
   abstract = {While the economic benefits of the resources boom in Australia have been considerable so, too, have the impacts upon host communities. These are particularly profound in settled regions where intensive mining presents amenity problems, housing shortages, increasing demands on infrastructure, environmental degradation and conflicts with other industries such as agriculture. Attempts to manage these challenges commonly occur through a 'governance' approach involving partnership and hybrid arrangements between a whole host of stakeholders from the corporate, state and community sectors. As the closest tier of government to the local level, local government has found itself playing a central role in mining governance, particularly in responding to and managing community concerns. This paper examines the role of, and challenges facing, local government in managing the impacts of mining - both alone and in collaboration with other governmental actors. It documents these issues as they relate to the resource needs, planning strategies, human capital impacts, service provision and institutional capacity of local governments in some of the most mining-intensive regions in Australia.},

   abstract = {Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provides an illustration of how crop protection has (or has not) evolved over the past six decades. Throughout this period, IPM has endeavored to promote sustainable forms of agriculture, pursued sharp reductions in synthetic pesticide use, and thereby resolved myriad socio-economic, environmental, and human health challenges. Global pesticide use has, however, largely continued unabated, with negative implications for farmer livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and the human right to food. In this review, we examine how IPM has developed over time and assess whether this concept remains suited to present-day challenges. We believe that despite many good intentions, hard realities need to be faced. 1) We identify the following major weaknesses: i) a multitude of IPM definitions that generate unnecessary confusion; ii) inconsistencies between IPM concepts, practice, and policies; iii) insufficient engagement of farmers in IPM technology development and frequent lack of basic understanding of its underlying ecological concepts. 2) By diverting from the fundamental IPM principles, integration of practices has proceeded along serendipitous routes, proven ineffective, and yielded unacceptable outcomes. 3) We show that in the majority of cases, chemical control still remains the basis of plant health programs. 4) Furthermore, IPM research is often lagging, tends to be misguided, and pays insufficient attention to ecology and to the ecological functioning of agroecosystems. 5) Since the 1960s, IPM rules have been twisted, its foundational concepts have degraded and its serious (farm-level) implementation has not advanced. To remedy this, we are proposing Agroecological Crop Protection as a concept that captures how agroecology can be optimally put to the service of crop protection. Agroecological Crop Protection constitutes an interdisciplinary scientific field that comprises an orderly strategy (and clear prioritization) of practices at the field, farm, and agricultural landscape level and a dimension of social and organizational ecology.},

   abstract = {Humanity is confronted with the grand challenge of how to increase agricultural production to achieve food security during the 21st century and feed a population that is expected to grow to 10 billion people. This needs to be done while maintaining sustainable agricultural systems and simultaneously facing challenges such as a changing climate, depletion of water resources, and the potential for increased erosion and loss of productivity due to the occurrence of extreme weather events. Precision Agriculture emerged out of the advances in the 1980s because of the development of several key technologies like GPS and satellite imagery. This paper argues that with the increasing impact of climate change, the next revolution in precision agriculture and agriculture in general will be driven by Sustainable Precision Agriculture and Environment (SPAE, similar to the 7 Rs), which could leverage past technologies combined with Big Data analysis. This new, technology-focused SPAE transitions from a site-specific management focus to the notion of global sustainability. To accomplish this transition, we introduced the WebGIS framework as an organizing principle that connects local, site-specific data generators called smart farms to a regional and global view of agriculture that can support both the agricultural industry and policymakers in government. This will help integrate databases located in networks of networks into a system of systems to achieve the needed SPAE management and connect field, watershed, national, and worldwide sustainability. Automation and the use of artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), drones, robots, and Big Data serve as a basis for a global “Digital Twin,” which will contribute to the development of site-specific conservation and management practices that will increase incomes and global sustainability of agricultural systems.},

Some have regarded this profusion of sub-national bodies as diminishing the role of the state. Certainly one result was ambiguity in the roles and responsibilities of different bodies and different levels of government. Weaving together these disparate initiatives into a coordinated system of regional governance is a significant challenge. A case study of the Central Queensland region supports recent sociological accounts of changes in governance notably those of Fung and Wright (Empowered Participatory Governance), Healey (Collaborative Planning) and Sorensen and Torfing (Network Governance). The analysis identifies institutional features and normative principles of an emerging, multi-layered and multi-stakeholder, form of governance where a network employing deliberative practices coordinates formal political institutions and other actors from non-state sectors. These offer a potential model of regional governance suggesting the network form (with a role for state actors, but not state-dominated) and deliberative decision-making practices may provide coherence and coordination in policy-formulation and administration at a regional level. © 2009 Public Policy and Administration SAGE Publications Ltd.},

Ever since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of architectural solutions are being proposed. Although there is a lack of widely accepted reference architectural solutions for digital twins, most of them are built using a combination of the layered and service-oriented patterns and address maintainability, performance efficiency, and compatibility quality attributes.},

   abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have become recognized as important management tools for marine and coastal ecosystems in the last few decades. However, the theoretical underpinnings of MPA regimes have arguably not yet received sufficient attention. This paper attempts to remedy this by exploring how the Cultural Theory initiated by Dame Mary Douglas can provide a theoretical foundation for the current debates about the design of MPA regimes. It does so by firstly noting that the various types of MPA governance discussed in the literature correspond to the ways of organizing, perceiving and justifying social relations recognized in Cultural Theory. The article continues by setting out how Cultural Theory helps to explain when and why MPA regimes succeed or fail to reach their goals. In particular, the article highlights the practical importance of accommodating all ways of organizing and perceiving social relations in any MPA management plan. Finally, the paper suggests that further systematic, empirical work for assessing MPAs needs to be undertaken so as to corroborate the arguments advanced in this paper.},

   abstract = {Controlling invasive species presents a public-good dilemma. Although environmental, social, and economic benefits of control accrue to society, costs are borne by only a few individuals and organizations. For decades, policy makers have used incentives and sanctions to encourage or coerce individual actors to contribute to the public good, with limited success. Diverse, subnational efforts to collectively manage invasive plants, insects, and animals provide effective alternatives to traditional command-and-control approaches. Despite this work, there has been little systematic evaluation of collective efforts to determine whether there are consistent principles underpinning success. We reviewed 32 studies to identify the extent to which collective-action theories from related agricultural and environmental fields explain collaborative invasive species management approaches; describe and differentiate emergent invasive species collective-action efforts; and provide guidance on how to enable more collaborative approaches to invasive species management. We identified 4 types of collective action aimed at invasive species—externally led, community led, comanaged, and organizational coalitions—that provide blueprints for future invasive species management. Existing collective-action theories could explain the importance attributed to developing shared knowledge of the social-ecological system and the need for social capital. Yet, collection action on invasive species requires different types of monitoring, sanctions, and boundary definitions. We argue that future government policies can benefit from establishing flexible boundaries that encourage social learning and enable colocated individuals and organizations to identify common goals, pool resources, and coordinate efforts.},

   abstract = {The concept of a digital twin of Earth envisages the convergence of Big Earth Data with physics-based models in an interactive computational framework that enables monitoring and prediction of environmental and social perturbations for use in sustainable governance. Although computational advances are rapidly progressing, digital twins of Earth have not yet been produced. In this Review, we summarize the methodological and cyberinfrastructure advances in Big Data that have advanced the progress towards a digital Earth twin. Data assimilation provides the framework for incorporation of high-resolution observations into Earth system models but lacks the decision-making interface and learning ability needed for the digital twin. Machine learning (and particularly deep learning) in Earth system science is now more capable of reaching the high dimensionality, complexity and nonlinearity of real-life Earth systems and is expanding the learning ability from Big Data. Progress in causal inference and reinforcement learning are, respectively, increasing the interpretability of Big Data and the ability of simulations to solve sequential decision-making problems. Social sensing data could provide inputs for multiagent deep reinforcement learning via feedback loops between agents and the environment, enabling large-scale applications in human system modelling. Future research must focus on finding the optimal way to integrate these individual methodologies to achieve digital twins. A digital twin of Earth would fully integrate Big Data observations within an Earth–human system model, to assess the interactions between these subsystems. This Review explores the current progress in Big Data manipulation in Earth sciences providing pathways toward digital twins of Earth.},

Yet because of its dynamic nature, collective action is difficult to measure and study. This article discusses ways of conceptualising collective action to provide researchers from various disciplines with a basic framework for understanding and studying collective action. It highlights specific features of collective action that are relevant to identify best practice methodological approaches and research techniques. The main part of the paper then describes how collective action can be operationalised, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different methods, as well as discussing complementarities among methods. This discussion provides an overview for subsequent studies in this special issue, which present applications of qualitative, quantitative, experimental, and action research methods for studying collective action. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A comparison of four similar policy cases in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and the European Commission reveals that successful public managers under certain conditions are able to construct and design productive mixtures of the three styles. They applied metagovernance, a process of designing and managing situationally optimal combinations of the three competing, and to an extent mutually undermining, governance styles. Their national cultures and politico-administrative traditions co-determined the governance mixture which would work in a given situation. The research reinforces the case already made by others, that governance doctrines cannot be transferred as 'best practices' from one nation to another without adaptation.

Digital twin technology is a particularly promising field that builds on AI and is already being utilized to increase efficiency and decrease costs in cattle livestock agriculture.

Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), AI, and even ML are only some current technologies that may be used for automated tracking of individual animal whereabouts. There is promise in using these methods and innovations to monitor and evaluate animal welfare, but these techniques are difficult. Just like other revolutionary innovations, the utilization of the DT mechanism will improve disease analysis prediction for individual farms by a factor of 92%. The responsiveness of DTLF will be a 92% response rate in analyzing the Heartbeat, a 94% effectiveness rate in analyzing the Temperature Range, and a 94% overall effectiveness in evaluating the Humidity Range.},

Technological advances over the last few years have greatly increased our ability to collect, collate and analyse our data on a per-tree basis at large orchard scales. We call this the Digital-Twin Orchard. A digital-twin is a virtual model of every tree and surroundings. The pairing of the virtual and physical worlds allows analysis of data and continuous monitoring of orchards production systems to predict stress, disease and crop losses, and to develop new opportunities for end-to-end learning. Monitoring of orchards is not a new concept but the digital-twin is a continuously learning system that could be queried automatically to analyse specific outcomes under varying simulated environmental and orchard management parameters. Digital-twin enables improvement of production and dynamic prediction of disease, stress and yield gaps using an end-to-end AI platform. In this paper, we present AgScan3D+: our automated dynamic canopy monitoring system to generate a digital-twin of every tree on a large orchard scale. AgScan3D+ consists of a spinning 3D LiDAR plus cameras that can be retrofitted to a farm vehicle and provides real time on-farm decision support by monitoring the condition of every plant in 3D such as their health, structure, stress, fruit quality, and more. The proposed system has been trialled in mango, macadamia, avocado and grapevines orchards and generated a digital-twin of 15,000 trees.

   abstract = {Over the last two centuries, the impact of the Human System has grown dramatically, becoming strongly dominant within the Earth System in many different ways. Consumption, inequality, and population have increased extremely fast, especially since about 1950, threatening to overwhelm the many critical functions and ecosystems of the Earth System. Changes in the Earth System, in turn, have important feedback effects on the Human System, with costly and potentially serious consequences. However, current models do not incorporate these critical feedbacks. We argue that in order to understand the dynamics of either system, Earth SystemModels must be coupled with Human SystemModels through bidirectional couplings representing the positive, negative, and delayed feedbacks that exist in the real systems. In particular, key Human System variables, such as demographics, inequality, economic growth, and migration, are not coupled with the Earth System but are instead driven by exogenous estimates, such as United Nations population projections.This makes current models likely to miss important feedbacks in the real Earth-Human system, especially those that may result in unexpected or counterintuitive outcomes, and thus requiring different policy interventions from current models.The importance and imminence of sustainability challenges, the dominant role of the Human System in the Earth System, and the essential roles the Earth System plays for the Human System, all call for collaboration of natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers in multidisciplinary research and modeling to develop coupled Earth-Human system models for devising effective science-based policies and measures to benefit current and future generations.},

   abstract = {This paper develops an agent-based model of a stylized low income region in order to study the impact of natural disasters on population displacement, income, prices, and consumption with a focus on distributions and coping strategies of low income groups. Key features of the model include the integration of decentralized markets into a full economy in a spatially explicit way and the analysis of short-run adjustment processes. The model is calibrated to a low income region of rural agrarian Pakistan that faced severe floods in 2010. Dynamic adaptation by agents in response to falling income includes migrating and running down savings. Despite these consumption smoothing strategies, some low income groups are vulnerable to starvation. The paper showcases two hypothetical policy scenarios, a cash and a food transfer program, and tracks their effects on the welfare of low income groups in the economy.},

   abstract = {This manuscript discusses the key characteristics of the Digital Ecosystems (DEs) model, which, we argue, is particularly appropriate for connecting and orchestrating the many heterogeneous and autonomous online systems, infrastructures, and platforms that constitute the bedrock of a digitally transformed society. Big Data and AI systems have enabled the implementation of the Digital Twin paradigm (introduced first in the manufacturing sector) in all the sectors of society. DEs promise to be a flexible and operative framework that allow the development of local, national, and international Digital Twins. In particular, the “Digital Twins of the Earth” may generate the actionable intelligence that is necessary to address global change challenges, facilitate the European Green transition, and contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. The case of the Destination Earth initiative and system is discussed in the manuscript as an example to address the broader DE concepts. In respect to the more traditional data and information infrastructural philosophy, DE solutions present important advantages as to flexibility and viability. However, designing and implementing an effective collaborative DE is far more difficult than a traditional digital system. DEs require the definition and the governance of a metasystemic level, which is not necessary for a traditional information system. The manuscript discusses the principles, patterns, and architectural viewpoints characterizing a thriving DE supporting the generation and operation of “Digital Twins of the Earth”. The conclusions present a set of conditions, best practices, and base capabilities for building a knowledge framework, which makes use of the Digital Twin paradigm and the DE approach to support decision makers with the SDG agenda implementation.},

   abstract = {Climate-smart forestry is a sustainable forest management approach for increasing positive climate impacts on society. As climate-smart forestry is focusing on more sustainable solutions that are resource-efficient and circular, digitalization plays an important role in its implementation. The article aimed to validate an automatic workflow of processing 3D pointclouds to produce digital twins for every tree on large 1-ha sample plots using a GeoSLAM mobile LiDAR scanner and VirtSilv AI platform. Specific objectives were to test the efficiency of segmentation technique developed in the platform for individual trees from an initial cloud of 3D points observed in the field and to quantify the efficiency of digital twinning by comparing the automatically generated results of (DBH, H, and Volume) with traditional measurements. A number of 1399 trees were scanned with LiDAR to create digital twins and, for validation, were measured with traditional tools such as forest tape and vertex. The segmentation algorithm developed in the platform to extract individual 3D trees recorded an accuracy varying between 95 and 98%. This result was higher in accuracy than reported by other solutions. When compared to traditional measurements the bias for diameter at breast height (DBH) and height was not significant. Digital twinning offers a blockchain solution for digitalization, and AI platforms are able to provide technological advantage in preserving and restoring biodiversity with sustainable forest management.},

AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future.},

Both state control and privatisation of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. Offering a critique of the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions.  She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organisations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

While the tragedy of the commons is real, there are many instances where institutions develop to protect against overexploitation. In this important work, the authors explore empirically, theoretically, and experimentally the nature of such institutions and the way they come about. Forests, irrigation systems, fisheries, groundwater basins, grazing lands, and the air we breathe are all examples of common-pool resources (CPRs). Because no one has property rights or control over such a resource, users of CPRs are frequently assumed to be caught in an inescapable dilemma---overexploitation of the resource, or what is commonly known as "the tragedy of the commons." Many well-documented examples of overexploitation exist. The users of commonly held resources have, however, in many instances overcome incentives to destroy the resources and have developed long-enduring institutions---rule-in-use---that enabled them to utilize these resources more effectively. Understanding the conditions under which users of CPRs successfully develop and maintain effective institutions is critical to facilitating improved resource policies. Using the analytic tools of game theory and institutional analysis and an empirical foundation based on controlled laboratory experiments and field data, this book explores endogenous institutional development. Specifically, this research focuses on three questions. In CPR dilemmas, to what degree are the predictions about behavior and outcomes derived from noncooperative game theory supported by empirical evidence? Where behavior and outcomes are substantially different from the predicted, are there behavioral regularities that can be drawn upon in the development of improved theories? What types of institutional and physical variables affect the likelihood of successful resolution of CPR dilemmas? This is a work of important relevance to all studying environmental issues from a wide variety of disciplinary perspectives.},

This is different from previously addressed energy sharing between buildings as our focus is on the improvement of community energy status, while traditionally research focused on reducing losses due to transmission and storage, or achieving economic gains. We model this problem in a multi-agent environment and propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solution. Results indicate that with time buildings learn to collaborate and learn a policy comparable to the optimal policy, which in turn improves the ZEC's energy status.

Additionally, this case considers some business-specific constraints, such as product compatibility, facility accessibility restrictions, prioritized locations, or biosecurity constraints. A digital twin–based approach is implemented at the farm level by installing sensors to remotely measure the inventories. Our approach combines biased-randomization techniques with a simheuristic framework to make use of data provided by the sensors. The analysis of results is based on these two real pilots and showcases the insights obtained during the IoFEED project.

Though great work has been done using adaptive agents in ABM, more research into the theoretical understanding of these systems would be useful. Adaptive agents have already been studied within machine learning (ML)—an area of artificial intelligence specifically concerned with adaptation and building internal models. The first part of this paper presents a framework for understanding ML as a component of ABM, and describes how different ML techniques can be incorporated into some ABMs. At the high level this framework consists of two cycles that involve evaluating input, making decisions and then generating output. Within this generalized framework, the ML algorithm is using the ABM as an environment and a reward generator , while the ABM is using the ML algorithm to refine the internal models of the agents. There are many details that must be answered before any ML technique can be incorporated into an ABM. In this paper I start to explore some guidelines for how to more closely integrate ABM and ML and will discuss complications that arise when combining ABM and ML techniques. To illustrate some of these issues , I will describe an integration of a ML technique within the El Farol Bar Problem.

Indeed, the UDT has increased the ability of planners to make decisions vis-à-vis data-driven city models; at the same time, however, it has attracted criticism because of its focus on the physical dimensions of cities. In facing these challenges, we seek to join the conceptual and practical efforts to generate a social turn in the field of Smart Cities and urban innovation. Creating a UDT with a social focus, we maintain, is not only a 1:1 translation of the built environment into the social realm, but also demands interdisciplinary knowledge from the fields of sociology, anthropology, planning, and ethics studies. This article makes theoretical and methodological contributions. Theoretically, it discusses the potential contribution of the Social Urban Digital Twin (SUDT) to the theory of urbanism, enabling us to represent the physical and the social environments as a single fabric. Methodologically, it enhances the know-how of the City Analytics research community by advancing a six-phase protocol for developing SUDTs, each phase of which integrates technological conceptions and social-theoretical content. The phases of the SUDT protocol are demonstrated using a specific case study: the experience of elderly residents of the Haifa neighborhood of Hadar—a low-income neighborhood in Israel characterized by ethnic and national diversity—during the Coronavirus pandemic.

Using the Ostroms' insights on co-production, institutional matching, and polycentricity, we argue that the ‘inherent’ nature of goods and their specific taxonomy are not static and definitive concepts but are instead contestable and dynamic features that are institutionally contingent. We explore four crucial mechanisms and/or contexts, not altogether unrelated, whereby the nature of goods becomes contestable and malleable: namely, (1) technological and geographical factors, (2) coproduction and entrepreneurial ingenuity, (3) bundling and unbundling of services, and (4) ideologies and regime shifts. This exercise has twofold purposes. First, we generalize the notion that there is nothing ‘inherent’ in the nature of goods and services and that they are fluid, heterogeneous, and malleable concepts. Second, we contribute to the debate on the provision of public goods and the role of civil society by highlighting the need for institutional malleability and diversity adaptive to changing technology, contexts, and institutional conditions.},

   abstract = {Social network analysis gives a rigid assessment of network structure while cultural theory helps explain management outcomes in more detail. The combination of these methods provides significant and alternative insights about the complexity of water pollution management. Applied in the case study of the Calumpang Watershed in the Philippines, two types of relations were evaluated, namely, resource sharing and cooperative activities. Factors affecting cooperation and the creation of bridges were assessed in social network analysis, while cultural theory was used to reveal the underlying views of key actors on the nature of the river and its management. Evidence showed that cooperation was significantly influenced by resource sharing regardless of institutional affiliation, while bridges were created by becoming the pools of information and resources in the network. Using cultural theory, this study found out that local government officials dominantly have a mixture of hierarchist and egalitarian views characterizing belief in both rule-bound and group-motivated actions to solve the water pollution problem. However, their egalitarian views on management did not manifest in the current network. The study concludes that collaborative partnerships for water pollution management can be facilitated by promoting resource flow, utilizing influential bridges in the network, and understanding the unconventional values of government actors. Combining social network analysis and cultural theory is recommended to generate a more critical assessment of the institutional complexity of pollution and other water issues in watersheds.},

In this work, we aim to: 1) provide a timely overview of this active emerging field, with a focus on 'post hoc' explanations, and explain its theoretical foundations; 2) put interpretability algorithms to a test both from a theory and comparative evaluation perspective using extensive simulations; 3) outline best practice aspects, i.e., how to best include interpretation methods into the standard usage of ML; and 4) demonstrate successful usage of XAI in a representative selection of application scenarios.

This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function τ (G,n) ∈ Rm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space.

They mirror physical assets in the digital world, enriching them with additional capabilities and features such as decision-making or lifecycle management. Due to the diverse possibilities associated with the Digital Twin, their design and implementation are also wide-ranging. This paper aims to contribute to the formalization and standardization of the description of Digital Twins. It presents a method for evaluating them through their lifecycle, from design to operation. The paper is based on an overview of their potential functionalities and properties with ranked stages of development. This method allows for an application-specific evaluation of Digital Twins and describes how they can be improved to suit the application better. The maturity model development follows the procedure for developing maturity models for IT management. Relevant capabilities and features were identified with a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines. The results of this review were ranked and categorized and constitute the core of the maturity model, which was validated on five use-cases from different domains in production and logistics. The maturity model assesses Digita Twins in seven categories (context, data, computing capabilities, model, integration, control, human-machine interface) with 31 ranked characteristics. It evaluates existing solutions for potential improvements for a given application or the transfer to a new use-case. The resulting method and a supplementary web service present a generalized model for the evaluation of Digital Twins. Based on a description of a potential application, this is the first step towards a systematic evaluation, improving the structured development of such applications},

To that end, we first provide a critical taxonomy of studies investigating agricultural robotic systems with regard to: (i) the analysis approach, i.e., simulation, emulation, real-world implementation; (ii) farming operations; and (iii) the farming type. Our analysis demonstrates that simulation and emulation modelling have been extensively applied to study advanced agricultural machinery while the majority of the extant research efforts focuses on harvesting/picking/mowing and fertilizing/spraying activities; most studies consider a generic agricultural layout. Thereafter, we developed AgROS, an emulation tool based on the Robot Operating System, which could be used for assessing the efficiency of real-world robot systems in customized fields. The AgROS allows farmers to select their actual field from a map layout, import the landscape of the field, add characteristics of the actual agricultural layout (e.g., trees, static objects), select an agricultural robot from a predefined list of commercial systems, import the selected UGV into the emulation environment, and test the robot’s performance in a quasi-real-world environment. AgROS supports farmers in the ex-ante analysis and performance evaluation of robotized precision farming operations while lays the foundations for realizing “digital twins” in agriculture.},

   abstract = {Digital Twins are very promising to bring smart farming to new levels of farming productivity and sustainability. A Digital Twin is a digital equivalent of a real-life object of which it mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime in a virtual space. Using Digital Twins as a central means for farm management enables the decoupling of physical flows from its planning and control. As a consequence, farmers can manage operations remotely based on (near) real-time digital information instead of having to rely on direct observation and manual tasks on-site. This allows them to act immediately in case of (expected) deviations and to simulate effects of interventions based on real-life data. This paper analyses how Digital Twins can advance smart farming. It defines the concept, develops a typology of different types of Digital Twins, and proposes a conceptual framework for designing and implementing Digital Twins. The framework comprises a control model based on a general systems approach and an implementation model for Digital Twin systems based on the Internet of Things—Architecture (IoT-A), a reference architecture for IoT systems. The framework is applied to and validated in five smart farming use cases of the European IoF2020 project, focussing on arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming and livestock farming.},

   abstract = {A vast number of pollutants are generated from on-road commuting vehicles, and there is an increasing need to explore vehicle emission monitoring and mitigation strategies. Traditionally, vehicle emissions can be monitored and measured directly from on-vehicle devices such as a sensor at the tailpipe, or based on expensive data collection tools such as roadside units; while another mainstream research estimates vehicle emissions by relying on the connection to the vehicle motions, which can approximately calculate vehicle emissions under certain traffic conditions. This paper proposes a virtual reality (VR) enabled digital twin platform for on-road emission monitoring, and it develops and evaluates eco-driving strategies within a specific area. The proposed approach, integrating a VR-based digital environment, a micro-simulation model for background traffic, and a Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator for emission estimation, offers an alternative to collect and examine vehicle emissions such as NOx under various traffic conditions. A case study on a central business area in Melbourne is conducted and eco-driving strategies are tested in two scenarios. The first scenario concerns the impact of hybrid electric vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles, which points to the long-term benefit of having controllable and cleaner modes of transportation as a strategy. Results showed that manipulating the penetration rate of emission-friendly engines or motions could reduce vehicle emissions effectively. The second scenario concerns the real-time eco-routing based on emission-optimum, which points to the short-term benefit of emission control strategies. Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to test drivers’ responses toward routing options. Results showed that over 90% of participants would follow the eco-routing recommendations completely. The presented study offers an alternative to data-generating, analyzing, and managing approaches for on-road emissions in urban transportation systems.},

As an emerging approach in intelligent manufacturing, the concept of digital twin has attracted increasing attentions due to its capability of monitoring engineering processes based on modeling and simulation in digital space. The application potential is highly expected especially for problems with complex mechanisms and high data dimensions, because the utilized platform in the digital twin can be easily extended to cover more mechanisms and solve highly complicated problems with strong nonlinearity compared with experimental studies in physical space. In this paper, a digital twin is designed to numerically model the representative mechanisms that affect the production unconventional reservoirs, such as capillarity, dynamic sorption, and injection salinity, and it incorporates multiscale algorithms to simulate and illustrate the effect of these mechanisms on flow and transport phenomena. The preservation of physical laws among different scales is always the first priority, and simulation results are analyzed to verify the robustness of proposed multiscale algorithms.},

   abstract = {Despite the growing interest in digital twins (DTs) in geospatial technology, the scientific literature is still at the early stage, and concepts of DTs vary. In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project—in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches.},

   abstract = {Recent years have witnessed significant advances in reinforcement learning (RL), which has registered tremendous success in solving various sequential decision-making problems in machine learning. Most of the successful RL applications, e.g., the games of Go and Poker, robotics, and autonomous driving, involve the participation of more than one single agent, which naturally fall into the realm of multi-agent RL (MARL), a domain with a relatively long history, and has recently re-emerged due to advances in single-agent RL techniques. Though empirically successful, theoretical foundations for MARL are relatively lacking in the literature. In this chapter, we provide a selective overview of MARL, with focus on algorithms backed by theoretical analysis. More specifically, we review the theoretical results of MARL algorithms mainly within two representative frameworks, Markov/stochastic games and extensive-form games, in accordance with the types of tasks they address, i.e., fully cooperative, fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We also introduce several significant but challenging applications of these algorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews on MARL, we highlight several new angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including learning in extensive-form games, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL in the mean-field regime, (non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning in games, etc. Some of the new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors and interests. Our overall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment of the current state of the field on the mark, to identify fruitful future research directions on theoretical studies of MARL. We expect this chapter to serve as continuing stimulus for researchers interested in working on this exciting while challenging topic.},

   abstract = {Digital twins are being adopted by increasingly more industries, transforming them and bringing new opportunities. Digital twins provide previously unheard levels of control over physical entities and help to manage complex systems by integrating an array of technologies. Recently, agriculture has seen several technological advancements, but it is still unclear if this community is making an effort to adopt digital twins in its operations. In this work, we employ a mixed-method approach to investigate the added-value of digital twins for agriculture. We examine the extent of digital twin adoption in agriculture, shed light on the concept and the benefits it brings, and provide an application-based roadmap for a more extended adoption. We report a literature review of digital twins in agriculture, covering years 2017-2020. We identify 28 use cases, and compare them with use cases in other disciplines. We compare reported benefits, service categories, and technology readiness levels to assess the level of digital twin adoption in agriculture. We distill the digital twin characteristics that can provide added-value to agriculture from the examined digital twin applications in agriculture and in other disciplines. Then, inspired by digital twin applications in other disciplines, we propose a roadmap for digital twins in agriculture, consisting of examples of growing complexity. We conclude this paper by identifying the distinctive characteristics of agricultural digital twins.},

This paper explicitly tackles parameter space exploration and calibration of ABMs by combining machine-learning and intelligent iterative sampling. The proposed approach “learns” a fast surrogate meta-model using a limited number of ABM evaluations and approximates the nonlinear relationship between ABM inputs (initial conditions and parameters) and outputs. Performance is evaluated on the Brock and Hommes (1998) asset pricing model and the “Islands” endogenous growth model Fagiolo and Dosi (2003). Results demonstrate that machine learning surrogates obtained using the proposed iterative learning procedure provide a quite accurate proxy of the true model and dramatically reduce the computation time necessary for large scale parameter space exploration and calibration.},

   abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful simulation technique which describes a complex dynamic system based on its interacting constituent entities. While the flexibility of ABM enables broad application, the complexity of real-world models demands intensive computing resources and computational time; however, a metamodel may be constructed to gain insight at less computational expense. Here, we developed a model in NetLogo to describe the growth of a microbial population consisting of Pantoea. We applied 13 parameters that defined the model and actively changed seven of the parameters to modulate the evolution of the population curve in response to these changes. We efficiently performed more than 3,000 simulations using a Python wrapper, NL4Py. Upon evaluation of the correlation between the active parameters and outputs by random forest regression, we found that the parameters which define the depth of medium and glucose concentration affect the population curves significantly. Subsequently, we constructed a metamodel, a dense neural network, to predict the simulation outputs from the active parameters and found that it achieves high prediction accuracy, reaching an R2 coefficient of determination value up to 0.92. Our approach of using a combination of ABM with random forest regression and neural network reduces the number of required ABM simulations. The simplified and refined metamodels may provide insights into the complex dynamic system before their transition to more sophisticated models that run on high-performance computing systems. The ultimate goal is to build a bridge between simulation and experiment, allowing model validation by comparing the simulated data to experimental data in microbiology.},

While the concept of a Digital Twin is nearly 20 years old, it continues to evolve as it expands to new industries and use cases. This has resulted in a continually increasing variety of definitions that threatens to dilute the concept and lead to ineffective implementations of the technology. There is a need for a consolidated and generalized definition, with clearly established characteristics to distinguish what constitutes a Digital Twin and what does not. This paper reviews 46 Digital Twin definitions given in the literature over the past ten years to propose a generalized definition that encompasses the breadth of options available and provides a detailed characterization which includes criteria to distinguish the Digital Twin from other digital technologies. Next, a process and considerations for the implementation of Digital Twins is presented through a case study. Digital Twin future needs and opportunities are also outlined.},

Built on the knowledge gained with the development of smart cities and the implementation of digital twins in other industries, urban digital twins have experienced a significant expansion in just a few years. However, this rapid growth has led to a fragmented situation where the definition of the concept of urban digital twin is not clear and implementations share few similarities. For this reason, the main objective of this paper was to contribute to the conceptualization of the digital twin in urban management. To do so, existing initiatives were mapped in terms of applications, inputs, processing and outputs. Requirements were elicited and the basic structure of a city digital twin was defined. Benefits, open issues and key challenges were also identified. This paper will be useful for stakeholders within the urban management area as it establishes the basis for the future design, development and widespread adoption of urban digital twins.},

We define various levels of predictability, and argue that insofar as path-dependency is a necessary attribute of a complex system, ruling out states of the system means that there is at least the potential to say something use-ful. ‘Wickedness’ is argued to be a more significant challenge to prediction than complexity. Critically, however, neither complexity nor wickedness makes prediction theoretically impossible in the sense of being formally un-decidable computationally-speaking: intractable being the more apt term given the exponential sizes of the spaces being searched. However, endogenous ontological novelty in wicked systems is shown to render prediction futile beyond the immediately short term.},

Both the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) have a strong focus on the natural environment and biological criteria for assessing the status of the relevant ecosystems. In the same time period, much research on environmental governance has focused on the interconnectedness of social systems and ecosystems, so-called social-ecological systems (SES). While having high aspirations, the legal frameworks underpinning current EU water and marine management do not necessarily reflect the advances of contemporary science relating to SES. Using the geographical intersection of the two directives, i.e., coastal waters as a focal point, the paper explores the inchoate integration of social and ecological perspectives in the EU marine governance. What are the main challenges for the current EU legal regimes for managing coastal waters in a way that builds on the understanding of social and ecological systems as interconnected? Having explored the two directives, the paper introduces the possibility of using marine spatial planning (MSP), and the EU directive establishing a framework for maritime spatial planning (MSPD) as a bridge between the social and ecological dimensions and discusses what implications this would have for the current system for governing coastal waters in Europe.},

However, capitalizing on these opportunities presents significant challenges and a multi-sectoral, integrated approach to managing marine socio-ecological systems will be required to achieve the full benefits projected for the blue economy. Integrated ecosystem assessments have been identified as the best means of delivering the information upon which marine resource management decisions can be made. By their nature, these assessments are inter-disciplinary, but to date have mostly focused on the natural sciences. Inclusion of human dimensions into integrated ecosystem assessments has been lagging, but is fundamental. Here we report on a Symposium, and the articles emmanating from it that are included in this Theme Set, that address how to more effectively include human dimensions into integrated ecosystem assessments. We provide an introduction to each of the main symposium topics (governance, scenarios, indicators, participatory processes, and case studies), highlight the works that emerged from the symposium, and identify key areas in which more work is required. There is still a long way to go before we see end-to-end integrated ecosystem assessments inclusive of all the major current and potential ocean use sectors that also encompass multiple aspects of human dimensions. Nonetheless, it is also clear that progress is being made and we are developing tools and approaches, including the human dimension, that can inform management and position us to take advantage of the multi-sectoral opportunities of sustainable blue growth.},

   abstract = {The area-wide management (AWM) of highly mobile insect pests such as tephritid fruit flies requires an integrated understanding of technical, social and institutional processes that drive a coordinated approach within a defined area. Furthermore, the success of an AWM programme is dependent upon the coordinated efforts of key stakeholders within the designated area (e.g. growers, community members). Yet, public views regarding AWM may not reflect those views held by scientists or stakeholders. Public considerations for acceptance are likely varied and multidimensional. A series of qualitative (phases 1-2) and quantitative (phase 3) studies examined stakeholder and community attitudes towards AWM to manage Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Tephritidae) and the novel use of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) as a possible component of AWM. Research was conducted over three regions of varying pest prevalence, ranging from zero to endemic; participants included growers, extension officers, industry and government representatives, and members of the general public. Participants in this research were asked to consider potential barriers and facilitators to the widespread uptake of AWM integrating the SIT, including any relevant institutional-level factors. Combined data revealed potential social barriers to AWM and SIT uptake. Most notably, there were perceptions of low efficacy in successfully coordinating key social groups for the purposes of an AW-IPM approach, and a concern for the possibility of ‘free-riders’ within an area-wide system. On the other hand, innovation complexity and observability of outcomes were important factors contributing to acceptance of AWM. Importantly, all participants were influenced by the attitudes and behaviours of important others. Participants also identified key facilitators that could assist in the uptake of AWM using the SIT. These facilitators include the importance of trustworthy information sources and harnessing the persuasive influence of community champions and central packing houses on commercial growers. Overall, there was high stated acceptance for the SIT, both on-farm and in towns, as long as SIT application was found to be economically feasible at individual farm or household level and the community was adequately consulted.},

   abstract = {This paper argues (1) that technology-specific policies are necessary if we are to meet the climate challenge and (2) that a main contribution of innovation system (IS) analysis to the study of sustainability transitions is that it allows policy makers to identify the processes and components in a system where intervention is likely to matter most. We demonstrate that an IS framework can identify a diverse set of system weaknesses in the field of environmental innovation and identify five venues for further research that can help strengthen the framework and improve its application to environmental innovations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Scientific modelling can make things worse, as in the case of the North Atlantic Cod Fisheries Collapse. Some of these failures have been attributed to the simplicity of the models used compared to what they are trying to model. MultiAgent-Based Simulation (MABS) pushes the boundaries of what can be simulated, prompting many to assume that it can usefully inform policy, even in the face of complexity. That said, MABS also brings with it new difficulties and potential confusions. This paper surveys some of the pitfalls that can arise when MABS analysts try to do this. Researchers who claim (or imply) that MABS can reliably predict are criticised in particular. However, an alternative is suggested – that of using MABS for a kind of uncertainty analysis – identifying some of the possible ways a policy can go wrong (or indeed go right). A fisheries example is given. This alternative may widen, rather than narrow, the range of evidence and possibilities that are considered, which could enrich the policy-making process. We call this Reflexive Possibilistic Modelling.},

   abstract = {“When I use a word, it means whatever I want it to mean”: Humpty Dumpty in Alice’s Adventures Through The Looking Glass, Lewis Carroll. “Digital twin” is currently a term applied in a wide variety of ways. Some differences are variations from sector to sector, but definitions within a sector can also vary significantly. Within engineering, claims are made regarding the benefits of using digital twinning for design, optimisation, process control, virtual testing, predictive maintenance, and lifetime estimation. In many of its usages, the distinction between a model and a digital twin is not made clear. The danger of this variety and vagueness is that a poor or inconsistent definition and explanation of a digital twin may lead people to reject it as just hype, so that once the hype and the inevitable backlash are over the final level of interest and use (the “plateau of productivity”) may fall well below the maximum potential of the technology. The basic components of a digital twin (essentially a model and some data) are generally comparatively mature and well-understood. Many of the aspects of using data in models are similarly well-understood, from long experience in model validation and verification and from development of boundary, initial and loading conditions from measured values. However, many interesting open questions exist, some connected with the volume and speed of data, some connected with reliability and uncertainty, and some to do with dynamic model updating. In this paper we highlight the essential differences between a model and a digital twin, outline some of the key benefits of using digital twins, and suggest directions for further research to fully exploit the potential of the approach.},

@article{kim2024agricultural,
   abstract = {A digital twin is a digital representation that closely resembles or replicates a real world object by combining interdisciplinary knowledge and advanced technologies. Digital twins have been applied to various fields, including to the agricultural field. Given big data and systematic data management, digital twins can be used for predicting future outcomes. In this study, we endeavor to create an agricultural digital twin using mandarins as a model crop. We employ an Open API to aggregate data from various sources across Jeju Island, covering an area of approximately 185,000 hectares. The collected data are visualized and analyzed at regional, inter-orchard, and intra-orchard scales. We observe that the intra-orchard analysis explains the variation of fruit quality substantially more than the inter-orchard analysis. Our data visualization and analysis, incorporating statistical models and machine learning algorithms, demonstrate the potential use of agricultural digital twins in the future, particularly in the context of micro-precision and individualized agriculture. This concept extends the current management practices based on data-driven decisions, and it offers a glimpse into the future of individualized agriculture by enabling customized treatment for plants, akin to personalized medicine for humans. A digital twin represents a real world object using available data. Here, the authors develop a digital twin for mandaring orchards in Jeju island showing the value of individualized agriculture to predict fruit quality at tree level.},

Manufacturing, health, and supply chain systems benefit from digital twins' predictive capacity to better plan and utilize costly and recently scarce resources. This research utilizes social media to drive a digital twin and model the propagation of an invasive species in the United States. 11,723 social media conversations considering the Spotted Lanternfly, an invasive species of insect that poises significant risk to crops and forests within the U.S., were utilized in the natural language processing and modeling. Converging the theory of sociomaterial assemblage and the emerging technology of digital twins, we have created machine learning models and an initial digital twin that predict the paths of these pests. This research advances modeling and simulation by applying the digital twin concept to the application of protecting industry against further natural disasters of crop destruction, resource and food shortage, and forest damage due to invasive species.},
