# Introduction
The concept of a digital twin (DT) comes from industrial production and space technology engineering and aims to optimise design and operations of complex processes through a highly interconnected workflow [^grieves2016digital] [^jones2020characterising]. The origin of the Digital Twin is attributed to Michael Grieves and his work with John Vickers of NASA. The initial description defines a DT as a virtual representation of a physical product containing information about said product, with its origins in the field of product life-cycle management.

DTs are digital replicas of actual physical systems (living or not, natural or manmade), interweaving solutions of complex systems analysis, decision support and technology integration

Pylianidis, C., Osinga, S., et al. (2021) [^pylianidis2021introducing]

:::{.sticky-note}
A dynamic virtual representation of a physical object or system, usually across multiple stages of its life-cycle, that uses real-world data, simulation, or machine learning models combined with data analysis to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning. DT can be used to answer what-if questions and should be able to present insights in an intuitive way.

A virtual representation of a physical system (and its associated environment and processes) that is updated through the exchange of information between the physical and virtual systems.

## Essential characteristics of Digital Twins
After Verdouw, C., Tekinerdogan, B., et al. (2021) [^verdouw2021digital]
- *timeliness*: (near) real-time updates such that changes in the physical object are (immediately) detected and synchronized with the digital twin.
- *fidelity*: unquestionable reliability
- *integration*: integrate data from different aspects of they physical world and ensure convergence in a consistent format.
- *intelligence*: include algorithms that describe, analyze or predict the behaviour of their physical twins.
- *complexity*: consider multiple interdependent objects as well as sub-systems at different levels of granularity.

## Why Digital Twins
DT have gained prominence, partially due to the uptake of Internet of Things (IOT) technologies, that allow for the monitoring of physical twins at high spatial resolutions, almost in real-time, through both miniature devices and remote sensing, that produce ever-increasing data streams.

The benefits of DT applications include reduced production times and costs, hiding the complexity of integrating heterogeneous technologies, creating safer working environments and establishing more environmentally sustainable operations.

## Goals and objectives of DTs
- **decision making**: be the central hub for informed decision making
- **monitoring**
- **prediction**: help look into the future; produce reliable predictions and allow fully multivariate testing of scenarios
- **prescription**: suggest actions, interventions based on the current and future data and outcomes of scenarios and simulations
- **multi-dimensional**: integration of human, social, economic and other dimensions

# Attributes/Features
*convergence of monitoring and modelling*
: 
- estimate uncertain model parameters and surrogate missing process details
- assimilate data from various external sources as well as the outputs of extensive simulations

*spatial*
: Spatially enabled DTs can provide valuable location-based insights, helping users to understand place-based policy and planning issues, test potential interventions, and deliver more sensible planning and development [^ANZLIC].


*virtual views*
: Multiple virtual views of the physical objects for different stakeholders, decision-makers, scenarios, etc.

*nesting and integration*
: Allow the nesting or integration of DTs of different-scale, per requirements. This can be more suited for virtual views based on user requirements/privileges. For example, a DT of natural landscape can be composed of DTs of farms, which can also be integrated more readily with farm management systems, for example.

*agile*
: Make the best use of IT and AI, such as data-science, ML and ABM to account for unknown processes and missing data and constraints. The system should also be able to learn and adapt itself from previous outputs and current and past measurements.

*interactive*
: Allow users to intervene, extract information and influence the system trajectory across time and space[^bauer2021digital].

*transparent*
: 

- When DTs are used to prescribe actions or make recommendations, it is important to make transparent the workings and underlying processes leading to them. In this aspect, the design of the UI is also important.
- At the same time, the risks associated with incomplete/incorrect DTs should be identified, along with any issues related to the recommendations 

# Types of  Digital Twins
 Verdouw, C., Tekinerdogan, B., et al. (2021) [^verdouw2021digital] have defined six types of digital twins based on the goals and workings of the DTs. These are:

1. Imaginary Digital Twin
1. Monitoring Digital Twin
1. Predictive Digital Twin
1. Prescriptive Digital Twin
1. Autonomous Digital Twin
1. Recollection Digital Twin

# How are DTs different from models and simulations
A simulation refers to a digital model that imitates the operations or processes within a system. Such simulations are used for analysing the performance of systems and testing and implementing new ideas[^wright2020how].

A digital twin has to be associated with an object that actually exists: a digital twin without a physical twin is a model. The concept of similarity of two things throughout development and evolution is key to the true digital twin, and for this similarity to be possible, the physical twin must also exist.

- A simulation/model replicates what could happen, whereas a digital twin replicates what is happening
- If an object does not change much over time, or if data associated with that change cannot be captured, then a digital twin is not likely to be useful.

Although simulations and digital twins both utilize digital models to replicate a systemâ€™s various processes, a digital twin is actually a virtual environment, which makes it considerably richer for study. The difference between digital twin and simulation is largely a matter of scale: While a simulation typically studies one particular process, a digital twin can itself run any number of useful simulations in order to study multiple processes.

Process understanding is core to science, and science can only progress with deepening understanding of the associated processes and interactions. There exist many process models (such as environmental models) that offer sophisticated representations of underlying phenomena/system/process. Process models are therefore core to digital twins of the natural environment. However, process models do not, yet, take advantage of the availability of large amounts of data; and they can become more useful to digital twins only if they become more dynamic structures that evolve over time [^blair2021digital].

##  Why digital twins vs simulations/models?
The use of evolving data means that a key strength of the digital twin approach is that it provides an accurate description of objects that change over time. A validated model can provide a snapshot of the behaviour of an object at a specific moment, but using that model within a digital twin can extend the use of that model to timescales over which the object and its behaviour will change significantly [^wright2020how].

By having better and constantly updated data related to a wide range of areas, combined with the added computing power that accompanies a virtual environment, digital twins are able to study more issues from far more vantage points than standard simulations can [^ibm2022what].

In addition to helping us extract new insights into extremes, change points, thresholds, clusters, and correlations that can inform the science (which can sometimes be done with data science or process models), digital twins allow us to alter not just the state but potentially the structure of the models or the mix of models in an ensemble to gain meaningful insights that can inform our actions in the opposite direction [^blair2021digital].
