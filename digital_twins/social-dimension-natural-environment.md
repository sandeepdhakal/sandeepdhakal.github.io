Pomeroy, R. S., Mascia, M. B., et al. (2007) [^pomeroy2007marine]
> Management approaches need to recognise the linkages between human and natural environments. Management tools and methods result from human decision-making processes and require changes in human behaviour to achieve success.
>
> The development, management and performance of the management tools are shaped by a convergence of institutional interests between resource users, resource stakeholders, community, local government, national government, and international agencies. 
>
> More often than not, social factors, not biological or physical variables, are the primary determinants of the success or failure of management tools. It is often more difficult to get the social components of the management tools 'right' than the biological or physical components.
>
> It is critical to recognise that each location has its unique social and ecological context that influences the design, implementation and impact of management tools. At the same time there might be several generalities and lessons which can be transferred over from one location to the other.

We need to understand:

- the attitudes, perceptions, beliefs and values of the various stakeholders,
- use patterns of the natural environment and resources,
- value provided by the management tools/methods,
- impacts of the management tools/methods on the stakeholders and the community,
- socio-economic trends or demographic characteristics,
- social capital

> Incorporating social science in the decision-making process can be useful for identifying affected groups, understand and reduce/avoid potential areas of conflict and contentious social interactions at multiple levels, gauge public perceptions of the focus and effectiveness of management tools/methods, predict potential outcomes of management decisions and strategies, enhance management effectiveness, among others.

> Much research on environmental governance has focused on the interconnectedness of social systems and ecosystems, so-called social-ecological systems (SES). This presents a shift away from traditionally strong sector-based approach towards a more holistic and area-based management aimed to ensure that human interaction with the ecosystem stays within ecologically safe boundaries [^boyes2016existing].

> A core tenet of many readings of ecosystem-based management is that social and ecological systems are effectively inseparable and must be considered together. This understanding of the interconnectedness of the human and ecological dimensions have led to calls for better inclusion of social aspects in legal and management structures that have tended to rely predominantly on the natural sciences [^link2017keeping].

> It has often been noted that a strict natural science or technical approach misses the multiple social dimensions that need consideration in ecosystem-based management. Although of fundamental importance, knowledge about ecosystem states and process will not deliver a comprehensive management without sufficient understanding of inter alia perspectives and preferences held by relevant groups or embedded in social structures.

> Human decisions are influenced by individual preferences, group dynamics, and top-down social, political, and economic forces. Decision-making therefore occurs simultaneously at multiple scales. Decisions at each scale interact with biophysical processes, often via imperfect linkages and feedbacks.

> The diversity of strategies in land-use management implies that various land managers may respond differently to the same set of opportunities. It also implies that decision strategies of groups of agents may be interdependent.

> Even with fixed potential choices and activities, human decisions may change over time and
context. Evidence indicates that human decision-making may be *time-inconsistent*.

> In case of communal resources, coordination between users and stakeholders is required.
> - How to human incentives lead to degradation of common pool resources?
> - how to factors such as trust and reciprocity affect the success of institutions that manage communal resources?

> The most influential drivers of change in a given natural resource may differ between human and natural systems. Similarly, changes that occur in human drivers over space and time are often independent from the state of, or changes in, the natural resource itself.

> Social policies at a regional level may also bring about changes in biophysical processes at landscape scales.

> - Spatial relationships, both human and biophysical, are an important source of potential disconnection between land use decisions and their impacts.
> - Spatial processes, human and natural, may also transfer natural resource impacts across time and > space.

> Questions related to how gradual changes on one dimension of the system can lead to abrupt changes on > the other dimension. For example, how drought conditions can lead to a critical threshold at which > farming-based livelihoods are no longer viable and land abandonment occurs.

## Challenges in building empirical models of complex land-use systems
In spite of the complexity of the systems under study, empirical models must be constructed to be as parsimonious as possible, so that relationships between model inputs and outputs can be traced and understood. Thus, any strategies for simplifying empirical models, that do not at the same time move the model away from a clear representation of the research question, are of practical use [^parker2008complexity].

- *model aggregates*: model populations of agents at a more aggregate level when such aggregation does not compromise the model's ability to address key research questions, or bias the results.

- *identify a minimum set of state variables*: model complexity can also potentially be reduced by restricting possible outcomes to those appropriate for a particular research case, rather than allowing all logically feasible outcomes.

- *combine multiple data sources*: while there might be significant challenges in linking multiple data sources, their availability may help modellers to build better structural representations of the system being studied.
