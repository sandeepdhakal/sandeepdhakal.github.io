# DTs in Agriculture
DT have rarely been utilised in agricultural applications, and their added value has not yet been discussed extensively [^pylianidis2021introducing].


*Some use cases reported in the literature*:

- mastitis in cows,
- bee colonies aiming to control their welfare and honey production,
- tomato crops in a greenhouse aimed to control the growing environment,
- agricultural farm equipments,
- orchards, pig farms, aquaponics production units, etc.

The general observation is that not many digital twins have been developed or are in an operational state. Few digital twins that have been developed are in their conceptual stages or they are abstract DTs.

Birks, D., Heppenstall, A., et al. (2020) [^birks2020towards] discussed the need for societal twins, *or digital replicas of social system that represent the decisions, behaviours and interactions of individual people, and, in turn, their emergent outcomes.*

# Examples from the Literature

## The Adoption of Urban Digital Twins

Ferré-Bigorra, J., Casals, M., et al. (2022) [^ferreBigorra2022adoption] reviewed and mapped existing urban digital twins in terms of their applications, inputs, processing and outputs. They excluded models that focused only on the economic or social aspects of the city.

Batty, M. (2018) [^batty2018digital] has expressed concern about the viability of an urban digital twin because of the challenge of integrating economic and social functions in the city.


## City Digital Twin Potentials: a Review and Research Agenda
Shahat, E., Hyun, C. T., et al. (2021) [^shahat2021city]

- highlights the need to clarify the potential of city digital twins and highlight the challenges that may hinder the full utilisation of this technology.

- a city digital twin can be thought of as a virtual mirror that encompasses all the elements that constitute the city, with the benefit of direct linkage between the model and the physical entity in real-time.

- "the city digital twin is perceived an enabling technology to promote situational awareness for city management and to provide a city information model."

- a digital twin can be a tool that promotes awareness and collaboration from the stakeholders for better management.

- "The improved modeling of socio-economic behavior and activities in addition to considering the contextual factors such as political settings, governance structures, and culture will provide better insights in understanding the city and performing more in- depth analysis and future scenarios simulations, which, in turn, will improve planning and decision-making."

- "There is a need to develop widely accepted standards to simplify the development and implementation of city models and gain the benefits of time, cost and error reduction"


## Digital Twin of an Organization: Are You Serious?
Becker, M. C. and Pentland, B. T. (2022) [^becker2022digital]

- building valid, reliable digital twins of organisations involves substantial challenges such as:
    + the digital twin has to be *discovered* from observation of the organisation and how it operates,
    + networks of interdependent processes,
    + agents that have *agency*: memory, imagination, analysing and responding, etc.; these agents often have conflicting goals,
    + agents and systems that learn

- "We envision the main use case for DTO to be helping managers understand *how* to intervene to solve organizational problems, design organizational structures, policies, and incentives."
    - Similar to the case of natural landscape management, where we need to understand how and when to intervene.


## Digital Twins in the Green Life Sciences
Knibbe, W. J., Afman, L., et al. (2022) [^knibbe2022digital]

-  investigate the practical challenges and benefits of digital twins in the green life sciences over alternative approaches. 

- green life sciences: includes the living environment, with subjects such as the terrestrial environment, climate, human and social processes, the entire system of agriculture, food, nutrition, and health, as well as plant and animal sciences.

- Even when real-time data is sparse, it can help verify the quality of the simulations, to adjust and re-calibrate the model or parameters (regularly and/or automatically).

## Digital Twins: Potentials, Ethical Issues, And Limitations
Helbing, D. and Sánchez-Vaquerizo, J. A. (2022) [^helbing2022digital]

- Benefits of digital twins:
    - exploratory and prospective power
    - digital twins allow performing otherwise unfeasible experiments

- what makes humans/societies difficult to represent in digital twins:
    - humans exhibit information processing, decision-making, learning, exchange knowledge, consciousness, changing goals over time, diverse goals/attitudes/norms, empathy, etc.
    - society is a result of the networked interaction of such diverse individuals, self-organisation and emergence.
    - the thinking, feeling, decisions and actions of humans cannot be measured well, or translated into algorithms.

    - need to deal with self-organisation and *network interactions* in complex systems. These are not necessarily problems, though. For example, self-organisation can help understand the resulting collective behaviour in such complex systems.

- digital twins should consider the effects of production and human activities on nature, and the effects of the environment on humans, society and production ().

- need to consider issues when policies are taken in response to extrapolated or inferred data, or in response in *predicted* futures that may never materialise.

## Towards the Development of Societal Twins
Birks, D., Heppenstall, A., et al. (2020) [^birks2020towards]

- Integration of the social aspects provide unique opportunities to focus on understanding the bottom-up mechanisms that drive complex systems such as cities, rather than concentrating purely on aggregate outcomes and thus, 'smoothing over' important lower-level dynamics.

- Key Challenges:
    - If societal twins are to be used to support real world decision making, we need a much better understanding of the uncertainties associated with underlying models.
    - Real-time modelling: could a digital twin, backed by an agent-based societal model, estimate the behaviour of the underlying system in *real-time*?

## Developing Human-Centered Urban Digital Twins for Community Infrastructure Resilience: a Research Agenda
Ye, X., Du, J., et al. (2023) [^ye2023developing]

- There is a growing focus on understanding the interactions between natural, physical, cyber and social systems for urban planning and management. Urban digital twins provide a platform for this transformation.
    - digital tools can provide a platform for stakeholders to analyse and visualise scientific information in an ad hoc digital environment, tailored to their needs.

- Such tools should enable decision makers to foresee the cascading impacts of various events and decisions. Up-to-date scientific knowledge needs to be delivered to the stakeholders in a timely fashion through virtual simulation and scenario planning to enhance collective decision making, optimise management and improve preparedness.

- Social systems can be integrated using methods such as ABMS and micro-simulation.
- knowledge graphs can also be useful in the development of such digital twins, particularly to understand things such as: the role of each subsystem and the integration/engagement between different subsystems.
