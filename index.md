Welcome to my knowledge base. I am a computer scientist working in computational social simulation and digital twins.

Here you will find notes I have created on topics including [agent-based modelling](agent-based-modelling.md), [digital twins](digital-twins.md), and general notes about python, data and geospatial data analysis, vim and linux in general.
