# My knowledge base

Welcome to my knowledge base. I am a computer scientist working in computational social simulation and digital twins.

Here you will find notes I have created on topics including [agent-based modelling](https://sandeepdhakal.github.io/agent-based-modelling.html), [digital twins](https://sandeepdhakal.github.io/digital-twins.html), and general notes about python, data and geospatial data analysis, vim and linux in general.
